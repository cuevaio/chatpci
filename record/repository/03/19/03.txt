3.19.3	Long-Term Constraint Competitiveness Test
(1)	The Long-Term CCT process is executed once a year and provides a projection of Competitive Constraints for the month with the highest forecasted Demand in the following year.  
(2)	The Long-Term CCT performs analysis on a selected set of constraints.  
(3)	A constraint is classified as a Competitive Constraint for the monthly case if it meets all of the following conditions:
(a)	The ECI is less than ECIT1 on the import side of the constraint;
(b)	The constraint can be resolved by eliminating all Available Capacity for a Resource on the import side, except nuclear capacity and minimum-energy amounts of coal and lignite capacity, that is Managed Capacity for a DME during peak Load conditions; and
(c)	There are negative Shift Factors corresponding to Electrical Buses with Available Capacity for a Resource that have an absolute value greater than or equal to SFP2.
[NPRR1182:  Replace paragraph (c) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(c)	There are Shift Factors corresponding to Electrical Buses with Available Capacity for a Resource that can help resolve the constraint by increasing power injection or reducing power withdrawal that have an absolute value greater than or equal to SFP2.
(4)	Any constraint that is analyzed and does not meet the conditions in paragraph (3) above will be designated as a Non-Competitive Constraint for the monthly case.
(5)	ERCOT shall update and post the list of Competitive Constraints identified by the Long-Term CCT on the MIS Secure Area.  The list of Competitive Constraints shall be posted at least 30 days prior to the first of the year.
