3.19.2	Element Competitiveness Index Calculation
(1)	To compute the ECI on the import side, first determine the “ECI Effective Capacity” available to resolve the constraint.  The ECI Effective Capacity that each Entity contributes to resolve the constraint on the import side is determined by taking, for each Managed Capacity for an Entity having negative Shift Factors with absolute values greater than the minimum of one-third of the highest absolute value of any Resource Shift Factor with a negative value and SFP1, the sum of the products of (a) the Available Capacity for a Resource and (b) the square of the Shift Factor of that Resource to the constraint.
[NPRR1182:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(1)	To compute the ECI on the import side, first determine the “ECI Effective Capacity” available to resolve the constraint.  The ECI Effective Capacity that each Entity contributes to resolve the constraint on the import side is determined by taking, for each Managed Capacity for an Entity having Shift Factors that can help resolve the constraint by increasing power injection or reducing power withdrawal with absolute values greater than the minimum of one-third of the highest absolute value of any Resource Shift Factor meeting this criterion and SFP1, the sum of the products of (a) the Available Capacity for a Resource and (b) the square of the Shift Factor of that Resource to the constraint.
(2)	ERCOT will determine the ECI on the import of the constraint, as follows:
(a)	Determine the total ECI Effective Capacity by each DME on the import side.  
(b)	Determine the percentage of ECI Effective Capacity by each DME on the import side by taking each DME’s ECI Effective Capacity and dividing by the total ECI Effective Capacity on the import side.
(c)	The ECI on the import side is equal to the sum of the squares of the percentages of ECI Effective Capacity for each DME on the import side.
