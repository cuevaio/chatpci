3.4	Load Zones 
(1)	ERCOT shall assign every power flow bus to a Load Zone for Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Settlement purposes.  ERCOT shall calculate a Settlement Point Price for each Load Zone using the Load-weighted aggregated Shift Factors of the applicable energized power flow buses for each constraint.  The Load-weighting must be determined using the Load distribution factors.
(2)	ERCOT shall assign every Electrical Bus to a Load Zone for Real-Time Market (RTM) Settlement purposes.  ERCOT shall calculate a Settlement Point Price for each Load Zone as the Load-weighted average of the Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) at all Electrical Buses assigned to that Load Zone.  The Load-weighting must be determined using the Load, if any, from the State Estimator at each Electrical Bus.
