3.4.3	NOIE Load Zones
(1)	The descriptions and conditions set forth below apply to Load Zones established by NOIEs:
(a)	There are four NOIE Load Zones that were approved prior to the Texas Nodal Market Implementation Date: Austin Energy, City Public Service, Rayburn Country Electric Cooperative, and Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA); 
(b)	Any costs allocated based upon a zonal Load Ratio Share (LRS) must be allocated using “Cost-Allocation Load Zones,” which are the four Load Zones in effect during the 2003 ERCOT market unless they are changed pursuant to Section 3.4.2, Load Zone Modifications.  For these allocation purposes, any NOIE Load Zone is considered to be located entirely within the 2003 ERCOT Congestion Management Zone (CMZ) that represented the largest Load for that NOIE or group of NOIEs in 2003;
(c)	A separate NOIE Load Zone is made up of a group of NOIEs that are parties to the same pre-1999 power supply arrangements and that had an overall 2003 peak Load in excess of 2,300 MW.  A NOIE that is a member of this separate NOIE Load Zone and that has given notice of termination of its pre-1999 power supply arrangement may elect to be assigned to an appropriate Competitive Load Zone.  Such an election shall be subject to the approval process in Section 3.4.2;
(d)	NOIEs may participate in only one NOIE Load Zone, and all Loads served by that NOIE must be contained within that Load Zone;
(e)	Except as specified otherwise in this subsection, Load Zones established by NOIEs will be treated the same as other Load Zones, including a 48-month notice requirement for ERCOT Board approval of any changes to Load Zones.  However, the addition of Load that is new to the ERCOT System, including the transfer of existing Load from a non-ERCOT Control Area, into an existing NOIE Load Zone is not a change to a Load Zone under these Protocols; and
(f)	Four years after a NOIE offers its Customers retail choice, the NOIE’s Load must be merged into the appropriate Competitive Load Zone(s).  For a Load Zone that is an aggregation of NOIE systems of which less than all of the NOIEs opt into Customer Choice, each remaining NOIE in that NOIE Load Zone may choose to have its Load merged into the appropriate Competitive Load Zone(s) under the same four-year time frame.
