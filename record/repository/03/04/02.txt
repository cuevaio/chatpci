3.4.2	Load Zone Modifications
(1)	Competitive Load Zones and NOIE Load Zones may be added, deleted, or changed, only when approved by the ERCOT Board, with the exception of paragraph (1)(c) of Section 3.4.3, NOIE Load Zones.  Approved additions, deletions, or changes go into effect 48 months after the end of the month in which the addition, deletion, or change was approved, with the exception of paragraph (3) below.  DC Tie Load Zones are not subject to these requirements.
(2)       The addition of Load that is new to the ERCOT System to an existing Load Zone does not constitute a change to a Load Zone under this section.  This provision includes the transfer of existing Load from a non-ERCOT Control Area into a Load Zone in the ERCOT System.  Adding Load that is new to the ERCOT System to an existing Load Zone does not require ERCOT Board approval, and no notice period is required prior to adding such Load to an existing Load Zone.
(3)	A NOIE that was included in the establishment of an automatic pre-assigned NOIE Load Zone under paragraph (1)(c) of Section 3.4.3 may elect to be assigned to an appropriate Competitive Load Zone after giving notice of termination of its power supply arrangement if a request to be assigned to a Competitive Load Zone was given to ERCOT at least 90 days prior to the start of the Pre-Assigned Congestion Revenue Right (PCRR) nomination window for the effective year of the Load Zone change.  The move to a Competitive Load Zone requires ERCOT Board approval and shall be effective no sooner than the first day of the PCRR Nomination Year.
