3.22.2	Subsynchronous Resonance Vulnerability Assessment Criteria
(1)	A Generation Resource is considered to be potentially vulnerable to SSR in the topology-check if a Generation Resource will become radial to a series capacitors(s) in the event of less than 14 concurrent transmission Outages.  A frequency scan assessment and/or a detailed SSR assessment shall be required to screen for system conditions causing potential SSR vulnerability.
(2)	In determining whether a Generation Resource is considered to be potentially vulnerable to SSR in the frequency scan assessment results, the following criteria shall be considered:
(a) 	Induction Generator Effect (IGE) and Subsynchronous Control Interaction (SSCI): 
(i)	When considering the total impedance of the generator and the applicable part of the ERCOT System, if the total resistance is negative at a reactance crossover of zero Ohms from negative to positive with increasing frequency, then the generator is considered to be potentially vulnerable to IGE/SSCI; 
(b) 	Torsional Interaction: 
(i)	If the sum of the electrical damping (De) plus the mechanical damping (Dm) results in a negative value then the generator is potentially vulnerable to Torsional Interaction.  Dm at +/- 1 Hz of the modal frequency may be utilized to compare to De; and 
(c) 	Torque Amplification: 
(i)	When considering the total impedance of the generator and the ERCOT system, if a 5% or greater reactance dip, or a reactance crossover of zero Ohms from negative to positive with increasing frequency, occurs within a +/- 3 Hz complement of the modal frequency, then the generator is considered to be potentially vulnerable to Torque Amplification.  The percentage of a reactance dip is on the basis of the reactance maximum at the first inflection point of the dip where the reactance begins to decrease with increasing frequency.
(3)	The detailed SSR assessment shall include an electromagnetic transient program analysis or similar analysis.  A Generation Resource is considered to be vulnerable to SSR if any of the following criteria are met:
(a)	The SSR vulnerability results in more than 50% of fatigue life expenditure over the expected lifetime of the unit;   
(i)	If the fatigue life expenditure is not available, the highest torsional torque caused by SSR is more than 110% of the torque experienced during a transmission fault with the series capacitors bypassed;
(b)	The oscillation, if occurred, is not damped; or
(c)	The oscillation, if occurred, results in disconnection of any transmission and generation facilities.
