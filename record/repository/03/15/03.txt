3.15.3	Generation Resource and Energy Storage Resource Requirements Related to Voltage Support
(1)	Generation Resources and ESRs required to provide VSS shall have and maintain Reactive Power capability at least equal to the Reactive Power capability requirements specified in these Protocols and the ERCOT Operating Guides.
(2)	Generation Resources and ESRs providing VSS shall be compliant with the ERCOT Operating Guides for response to transient voltage disturbance.
(3)	Generation Resources and ESRs providing VSS must meet technical requirements specified in Section 8.1.1.1, Ancillary Service Qualification and Testing, and the performance standards specified in Section 8.1.1, QSE Ancillary Service Performance Standards.
(4)	Each Generation Resource and ESR providing VSS shall operate with the unit’s Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) in the automatic voltage control mode unless specifically directed to operate in manual mode by ERCOT, or when the unit is telemetering its Resource Status as STARTUP, SHUTDOWN, or ONTEST, or the QSE determines a need to operate in manual mode due to an undue threat to safety, undue risk of bodily harm, or undue damage to equipment at the generating plant.
(5)	Each Generation Resource and ESR providing VSS shall maintain the Voltage Set Point established by ERCOT, the interconnecting TSP, or the TSP’s agent, subject to the Generation Resource’s or ESR’s operating characteristic limits, voltage limits, and within tolerances identified in paragraph (4) of Nodal Operating Guide Section 2.7.3.5, Resource Entity Responsibilities and Generation Resource and Energy Storage Resource Requirements.
(6)	The reactive capability required must be maintained at all times that the Generation Resource or ESR is On-Line.
(7)	Each QSE shall send to ERCOT, via telemetry, the AVR and Power System Stabilizer (PSS) status for each of its Generation Resources providing VSS.  Each QSE shall send to ERCOT via telemetry the AVR status for each of its ESRs providing VSS.  For AVRs, an “On” status will indicate the AVR is on and set to regulate the Resource’s terminal voltage in the voltage control mode, and an “Off” status will indicate the AVR is off or in a manual mode.  For PSS, an “On” status will indicate the service is enabled and ready for service, and an “Off” status will indicate it is off or out of service.  Each QSE shall monitor the status of its Generation Resources’ and ESRs’ regulators and stabilizers, and shall report status changes to ERCOT.
(8)	Each Resource Entity shall provide information related to the tuning parameters, local or inter-area, of any PSS installed at a Generation Resource.
(9)	If any individual Resource within a Self-Limiting Facility is incapable of meeting its Reactive Power requirement at the POI, the QSE must bring On-Line additional Resource(s) within the Self-Limiting Facility to provide VSS as specified in paragraph (4) of Section 3.15, Voltage Support, while respecting the limit on MW Injection.
(10)	The Resource Entity for an IRR synchronized to the ERCOT System that is not capable of providing Reactive Power when not producing real power shall:
(a)	When capable of providing real power, set the IRR’s Low Sustained Limit (LSL) to 0 MW, or the lowest MW level, not to exceed 1 MW, at which the IRR can provide stable Reactive Power after appropriate tuning of settings;
(b)	Ensure the lowest MW point on the submitted reactive capability curve reflects 0 MVAr leading and lagging reactive capability at 0 MW; 
(c)	Ensure the second-lowest MW point on the submitted reactive capability curve accurately reflects the IRR’s leading and lagging reactive capability at its LSL when the LSL is not 0 MW; and
(d)	Send to ERCOT, via telemetry, an AVR status of “Off” when the IRR is synchronized to the ERCOT System and not producing Reactive Power.
(11)	The Resource Entity for an IRR synchronized to the ERCOT System that is capable of providing any net Reactive Power when not producing real power shall:
(a)	Provide stable Reactive Power output at all MW levels at which the IRR has Reactive Power capability; 
(b)	When capable of providing real power, set the IRR LSL to 0 MW or the lowest MW level, not to exceed 1 MW, at which the IRR can provide stable Reactive Power after appropriate tuning of settings;
(c)	Ensure the lowest MW point on the submitted reactive capability curve accurately reflects the IRR’s MVAr leading and lagging reactive capability when not producing real power; 
(d)       Ensure the second-lowest MW point on the submitted reactive capability curve accurately reflects the IRR’s leading and lagging reactive capability at its LSL when the LSL is not 0 MW;
(e)	Send to ERCOT, via telemetry, an AVR status of “On” when the IRR is synchronized to the ERCOT System, not producing real power, and reactive control is working properly; and
(f)	Meet the requirements in paragraphs (2), (4), (5), and (7) above when the IRR is synchronized to the ERCOT System and not producing real power.
(12)	The Resource Entity for an IRR that is capable of providing any net Reactive Power when not producing real power may physically desynchronize its inverters from the ERCOT System instead of providing Reactive Power when not producing real power.
