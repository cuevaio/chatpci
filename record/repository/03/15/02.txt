3.15.2	DSP Responsibilities Related to Voltage Support
(1)	Each DSP and Resource Entity within a Private Use Network shall meet the requirements specified in this subsection, or at their option, may meet alternative requirements specifically approved by ERCOT.  Such alternative requirements may include requirements for aggregated groups of Facilities.
(a)	Sufficient static Reactive Power capability shall be installed by a DSP or a Resource Entity within a Private Use Network not subject to a DSP tariff in substations and on the distribution voltage system to maintain at least a 0.97 lagging power factor for the maximum net active power measured in aggregate on the distribution voltage system.  In those cases where a Private Use Networkâ€™s power factor is established and governed by a DSP tariff, a Resource Entity within a Private Use Network shall ensure that the Private Use Network meets the requirements as defined and measured in the applicable tariff.  
(b)	DSP substations whose annual peak Load has exceeded ten MW shall have and maintain Watt/VAr metering sufficient to monitor compliance; otherwise, DSPs are not required to install additional metering to determine compliance.
(c)	All DSPs shall report any changes in their estimated net impact on ERCOT as part of the annual Load data assessment.
(d)	As part of the annual Load data assessment, all Resource Entities owning Generation Resources shall provide an annual estimate of the highest potential affiliated MW and MVAr Load (including any Load netted with the generation output) and the highest potential MW and MVAr generation that could be experienced at the POIB, based on the current configuration (and the projected configuration if the configuration is going to change during the year) of the Generation Resource and any affiliated Loads.
