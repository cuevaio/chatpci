3.10.6	QSE and Resource Entity Responsibilities
(1)	Resource Entities shall provide Resource Registration data pursuant to Planning Guide Section 6.8.2, Resource Registration Process, to ERCOT and to TSPs upon request.  The Resource Registration data will contain information describing each Generation Resource, SOG, and Load Resource that it represents under Section 3.10.7.2, Modeling of Resources and Transmission Loads.
[NPRR995:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(1)	Resource Entities shall provide Resource Registration data pursuant to Planning Guide Section 6.8.2, Resource Registration Process, to ERCOT and to TSPs upon request.  The Resource Registration data will contain information describing each Generation Resource, SOG, SOESS, and Load Resource that it represents under Section 3.10.7.2, Modeling of Resources and Transmission Loads.
(2)	QSEs shall ensure availability of telemetry to generation and transmission equipment its Resource Entity owns at ERCOT’s request to maintain observability and redundancy requirements as specified herein, and under Section 3.10.7.5, Telemetry Requirements.  ERCOT shall request such additions when a lack of data telemetry has caused, or can be demonstrated to result in, inaccuracies between Real-Time measurements and modeling outcomes that could result in incorrect LMP prices or potential reliability problems.
(3) 	For each Generation Resource and Energy Storage Resource (ESR), Resource Entities shall provide ERCOT the following temperature data: 
(a) 	Cold weather temperature limits:
(i) 	Minimum historical ambient dry bulb temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at which the Resource has operated without a Forced Outage or Startup Loading Failure due to cold weather after at least one complete winter Peak Load Season following the Resource’s Initial Synchronization date based on the previous five calendar years of historical data; and
(ii) 	Minimum historical ambient dry bulb temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at which the Resource has operated without experiencing a Forced Derate greater than 10 MW and 5% of its winter Seasonal net maximum rating due to cold weather after at least one complete winter Peak Load Season following the Resource’s Initial Synchronization date based on the previous five calendar years of historical data; and
(iii)  	At least one of the following:
(A)	Minimum ambient dry bulb temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at which the Resource was designed to operate without a Forced Derate greater than 10 MW and 5% of its winter Seasonal net maximum sustainable rating; or 
(B)	Minimum ambient dry bulb temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at which the Resource can operate without a Forced Derate greater than 10 MW and 5% of its winter Seasonal net maximum sustainable rating determined by an engineering analysis; and
(iv)  	At least one of the following: 
(A) 	Minimum ambient dry bulb temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at which the Resource was designed to operate without a Forced Outage or Startup Loading Failure; or
(B)	Minimum ambient dry bulb temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at which the Resource can operate without a Forced Outage or Startup Loading Failure determined by an engineering analysis.
(b) 	Hot weather temperature limits:
(i)	Maximum historical ambient dry bulb temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at which the Resource has operated without experiencing a Forced Outage or Startup Loading Failure due to hot weather after at least one complete summer Peak Load Season following the Resource’s Initial Synchronization date based on the previous five years of historical data; and
(ii)	Maximum historical ambient dry bulb temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at which the Resource has operated without experiencing a Forced Derate greater than 10 MW and 5% of its summer Seasonal net maximum sustainable rating due to hot weather after at least one complete summer Peak Load Season following the Resource’s Initial Synchronization date based on the previous five calendar years of historical data; and 
      (iii)	At least one of the following: 
(A)	Maximum ambient dry bulb temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at which the Resource was designed to operate without a Forced Derate greater than 10 MW and 5% of its summer Seasonal net maximum sustainable rating; or 
(B)	Maximum ambient dry bulb temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at which the Resource can operate without a Forced Derate greater than 10 MW and 5% of its summer Seasonal net maximum sustainable rating, determined by an engineering analysis; and
      (iv)	At least one of the following:
(A)	Maximum ambient dry bulb temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at which the Resource was designed to operate without a Forced Outage or Startup Loading Failure; or 
(B) 	Maximum ambient dry bulb temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at which the Resource can operate without a Forced Outage or Startup Loading Failure, determined by an engineering analysis.
(4)  	Each Resource Entity shall review at least annually the temperatures described in paragraphs (3)(a)(i), (3)(a)(ii), (3)(b)(i), and (3)(b)(ii) above and shall update each Resource’s Registration data within 30 days of identifying any change in these temperatures.
(5)	Each Resource Entity shall review at least once every seven years the temperatures described in paragraphs (3)(a)(iii), (3)(a)(iv), (3)(b)(iii), and (3)(b)(iv) above and shall update each Resource’s Registration data within 30 days of identifying any change in these temperatures.
(6)	Resource Entities shall update each Generation Resource’s alternate fuel information within 30 days of any changes to the alternate fuel information.
