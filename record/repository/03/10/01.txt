3.10.1	Time Line for Network Operations Model Changes
(1)	ERCOT shall perform periodic updates to the Network Operations Model.  Market Participants may provide Network Operations Model updates to ERCOT to implement planned transmission and Resource construction one year before the required submittal date below.  TSPs and Resource Entities must timely submit Network Operations Model changes pursuant to the schedule in this Section to be included in the updates.
[NPRR857:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation and satisfying the following conditions: (1) Southern Cross provides ERCOT with funds to cover the entire estimated cost of the project; and (2) Southern Cross has signed an interconnection agreement with a TSP and the TSP gives ERCOT written notice that Southern Cross has provided it with:  (a) Notice to proceed with the construction of the interconnection; and (b) The financial security required to fund the interconnection facilities:]
(1)	ERCOT shall perform periodic updates to the Network Operations Model.  Market Participants may provide Network Operations Model updates to ERCOT to implement planned transmission and Resource construction one year before the required submittal date below.  TSPs, DCTOs, and Resource Entities must timely submit Network Operations Model changes pursuant to the schedule in this Section to be included in the updates.
(2)	For a facility addition, revision, or deletion to be included in any Network Operations Model update, all technical modeling information must be submitted to ERCOT pursuant to the ERCOT NOMCR process or the applicable Resource Registration process for Resource Entities.  If a Resource Entity is required to follow the generation interconnection process for a new Generation Resource or Settlement Only Generator (SOG) as described in Planning Guide Section 5, Generator Interconnection or Modification, it must meet the conditions of Planning Guide Section 6.9, Addition of Proposed Generation to the Planning Models, before submitting a change to the Network Operations Model to reflect the new Generation Resource or SOG.
[NPRR995:  Replace paragraph (2) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(2)	For a facility addition, revision, or deletion to be included in any Network Operations Model update, all technical modeling information must be submitted to ERCOT pursuant to the ERCOT NOMCR process or the applicable Resource Registration process for Resource Entities.  If a Resource Entity is required to follow the generation interconnection process for a new Generation Resource, Settlement Only Generator (SOG), or Settlement Only Energy Storage System (SOESS) as described in Planning Guide Section 5, Generator Interconnection or Modification, it must meet the conditions of Planning Guide Section 6.9, Addition of Proposed Generation to the Planning Models, before submitting a change to the Network Operations Model to reflect the new Generation Resource, SOG, or SOESS.
(3)	TSPs and Resource Entities shall submit Network Operations Model updates at least three months prior to the physical equipment change.  ERCOT shall update the Network Operations Model according to the following table:

Notes: 
1.	TSP and Resource Entity data submissions complete per the NOMCR process or other ERCOT-prescribed process applicable to Resource Entities for inclusion in next update period.
2.	Network Operations Model data changes and preliminary fidelity test complete by using the Network Operations Model test facility described in paragraph (3) of Section 3.10.4, ERCOT Responsibilities.  A test version of the Redacted Network Operations Model will be posted to the MIS Secure Area for Market Participants and Network Operations Model to the MIS Certified Area for TSPs as described in paragraph (9) of Section 3.10.4, for market review and further testing by Market Participants.
3.	Testing of the Redacted Network Operations Model by Market Participants and Network Operations Model by TSPs is complete and ERCOT begins the Energy Management System (EMS) testing prior to placing the new model into the production environment.
4.	Updates include changes starting at this date and ending within the same month.  The schedule for Operations Model load dates will be published by ERCOT on the ERCOT website.
