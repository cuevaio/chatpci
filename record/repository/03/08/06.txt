3.8.6	Distribution Generation Resources (DGRs) and Distribution Energy Storage Resources (DESRs)
(1)	As a condition for the interconnection of a DGR or DESR, the affected Resource Entity, after consultation with the relevant Distribution Service Provider (DSP), shall provide documentation from the DSP to ERCOT stating that the interconnecting distribution circuit will not be disconnected as part of an Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) Level 3, an under-frequency Load shedding event, or an under-voltage Load shedding event, unless required for DSP local system maintenance or during a DSP local system emergency.  
(a)	If a DSP subsequently determines that any circuit to which a DGR or DESR is interconnected will need to be disconnected during these Load shedding events, or that a DGR or DESR will need to be moved to a circuit that will be disconnected during these Load shedding events:
(i)	The DSP shall promptly notify the designated contact for the DGR or DESR;
(ii)	The Resource Entity shall promptly notify ERCOT of this fact via the Resource Registration process; and 
(iii)	The DGR or DESR will immediately be disqualified from offering to provide any Ancillary Service.
(b)	Upon receiving notification from the DSP that the DGR or DESR is no longer subject to disconnection during any of these Load shedding events, and that no known system limitations or changes have occurred that would inhibit the DGR or DESR from complying with Ancillary Service performance requirements, the Resource Entity for the DGR or DESR shall notify ERCOT of this fact via the Resource Registration process and will, at that time, be eligible to offer to provide Ancillary Services if the Resource is otherwise qualified to do so.
[NPRR1171 and NPRR1213:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation for NPRR1171; or upon system implementation and upon system implementation of NPRR1171 for NPRR1213, and renumber accordingly:]
(1)	As a condition for the interconnection of a DGR or DESR, the affected Resource Entity, after consultation with the relevant Distribution Service Provider (DSP), shall submit an executed Section 23, Form R, Interconnection Circuit Designation for Distribution Generation Resources (DGRs) and Distribution Energy Storage Resources (DESRs).
(a)	The DSP shall indicate that the interconnecting distribution circuit for the DGR or DESR is subject to Load shed if the DSP determines that the distribution circuit may be disconnected as part of an Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) Level 3 Load shedding event, an Under-Frequency Load Shed (UFLS) event, or an Under-Voltage Load Shed (UVLS) event.
(b)	The DSP shall indicate that the interconnecting distribution circuit for the DGR or DESR is not subject to Load shed if the DSP determines that the distribution circuit will not be disconnected for any Load shed purpose during any of the events listed in paragraph (a) above.  This condition may be met where:
(i)	A DGR or DESR is connected to a distribution circuit which the DSP has excluded from Load shedding events, which may include, but is not limited to, a distribution circuit that interconnects only DGRs or DESRs; or
(ii)	A DGR or DESR is connected to a distribution circuit where a recloser or other sectionalizing device excludes the DGR or DESR from Load shedding events on the distribution circuit.
(c)	If the DSP has indicated that the interconnecting distribution circuit may be subject to Load shed, the DGR or DESR may qualify to provide only the following Ancillary Services, subject to the limits established by ERCOT pursuant to Section 3.16, Standards for Determining Ancillary Service Quantities:
(i)	Non-Spinning Reserve (Non-Spin);
(ii)	ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service (ECRS); and 
(iii)	Regulation Down Service (Reg-Down).
(d)	If the DSP has indicated that the interconnecting distribution circuit is not subject to Load shed, then the DGR or DESR shall not be subject to the Ancillary Service qualification limitations described in paragraph (c) above.
(e)	The DSP shall identify on Section 23, Form R, whether the DSP has identified any operational limitations for the DGR or DESR based on known system limitations and planning or operational studies, including studies performed in accordance with Planning Guide Section 5.4.2, Submission of Interconnection Agreement and TSP and/or DSP Studies and Technical Requirements.  Temporary limitations, such as may occur during maintenance outage conditions, are not required to be reported on Section 23, Form R.
(2)	If a DSP at any time after the interconnection of a DGR or DESR determines that any circuit to which the DGR or DESR is interconnected will be subject to Load shed during any of the Load shedding events listed in paragraph (1)(a) above, or that a DGR or DESR will need to be electrically relocated to a circuit that will be subject to Load shed during these Load shedding events:
(a)	The DSP shall promptly notify ERCOT and the designated contact for the DGR or DESR;
(b)	The Resource Entity for the DGR or DESR shall promptly submit an updated Section 23, Form R, to ERCOT and shall make a corresponding update to its Resource Registration data; and
(c)	The Ancillary Service qualification limitations in paragraph (1)(c) above will apply to the DGR or DESR.
(3)	If a DGR or DESR is interconnected to a circuit that is subject to Load shed and then either is relocated to a different circuit that is not subject to Load shed during any of the Load shed events listed in paragraph (1)(a) above or receives notification from the DSP that the DGR or DESR is no longer subject to Load shed during any of these events, the Resource Entity for the DGR or DESR shall submit an updated Section 23, Form R, to ERCOT and shall make a corresponding update to its Resource Registration data.
(2)	For a proposed conversion of an existing Settlement Only Distribution Generator (SODG) to a DGR or DESR, the interconnecting DSP will evaluate the proposed conversion and will determine whether it is electrically and operationally feasible.  If the interconnecting DSP determines that the conversion is not electrically or operationally feasible, the DSP may disallow the conversion. 
[NPRR995 and NPRR1171:  Replace applicable portions of paragraph (2) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(2)	For a proposed conversion of an existing Settlement Only Distribution Generator (SODG) to a DGR or for a proposed conversion of an existing Settlement Only Distribution Energy Storage System (SODESS) to a DESR, the Resource Entity will follow the generation interconnection process outlined in Planning Guide Section 5, Generator Interconnection or Modification.
(3)	The Resource Node for a DGR or DESR shall be fixed at a single Electrical Bus in the ERCOT Network Operations Model.
(a)	If a DSP determines that a topology change has altered, or is expected to alter, the electrical path connecting the DGR or DESR to the ERCOT Transmission Grid for a period longer than 60 days:
(i)	The DSP shall promptly notify the interconnecting Transmission Service Provider (TSP) and the designated contact for the DGR or DESR, and the interconnecting TSP shall notify ERCOT; and
(ii)	The Resource Entity shall submit a change request to ERCOT via the Resource Registration process.
