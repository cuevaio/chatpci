3.8.2	Combined Cycle Generation Resources
(1)	ERCOT shall assign a logical Resource Node for use in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM), RUC, Supplemental Ancillary Services Market (SASM), Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) and Load Frequency Control (LFC) to each registered Combined Cycle Train.  Each Combined Cycle Generation Resource registered in the Combined Cycle Train will be mapped to the Combined Cycle Train logical Resource Node for the purposes of evaluating and settling each Combined Cycle Generation Resource’s Three-Part Supply Offer and Ancillary Service Offer in the DAM, RUC and SCED.  Each generation unit identified in the Combined Cycle Train registration for a Combined Cycle Generation Resource configuration will be mapped to its designated Resource Node as determined in accordance with these Protocols and the Other Binding Document titled “Procedure for Identifying Resource Nodes.”
[NPRR1007:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]
(1)	ERCOT shall assign a logical Resource Node for use in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM), RUC, Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) and Load Frequency Control (LFC) to each registered Combined Cycle Train.  Each Combined Cycle Generation Resource registered in the Combined Cycle Train will be mapped to the Combined Cycle Train logical Resource Node for the purposes of evaluating and settling each Combined Cycle Generation Resource’s Three-Part Supply Offer and Ancillary Service Offer in the DAM, RUC and SCED.  Each generation unit identified in the Combined Cycle Train registration for a Combined Cycle Generation Resource configuration will be mapped to its designated Resource Node as determined in accordance with these Protocols and the Other Binding Document titled “Procedure for Identifying Resource Nodes.”
(2)	If any of the generation units, designated in the Combined Cycle Train registration as a primary generation unit in a Combined Cycle Generation Resource, is isolated from the ERCOT Transmission Grid because of a transmission Outage reported in the Outage Scheduler, the DAM and RUC applications shall select an alternate generation unit for use in the application.
(3)	Three-Part Supply Offers submitted for a Combined Cycle Generation Resource will be modeled as High Reasonability Limit (HRL)-weighted injections at the Resource Connectivity Nodes of the associated Generation Resources.  ERCOT shall use the logical Resource Node to settle these offers. 
(4)	In the DAM and RUC, ERCOT shall model the energy injection from each generation unit registered to the Combine Cycle Generation Resource designated in a Three-Part Supply Offer as follows:
(a)	The energy injection for each generation unit registered in the Combined Cycle Generation Resource designated in a Three-Part Supply Offer shall be the offered energy injection for the selected price point on the Three-Part Supply Offer’s Energy Offer Curve times a weight factor as determined in paragraph (4)(b) below. 
(b)	The weight factor for each generation unit registered in a Combined Cycle Generation Resource shall be the generation unit’s HRL, as specified in the Resource Registration data provided to ERCOT pursuant to Planning Guide Section 6.8.2, Resource Registration Process, divided by the total of all HRL values for the generation units registered in the designated Combined Cycle Generation Resource.
(5)	In the Network Operations Network Models used in the DAM, RUC and SCED applications, each generation unit identified in the Combined Cycle Train registration must be modeled at its Resource Connectivity Node.
(6)	For Ancillary Services offered and provided from Combined Cycle Generation Resources, ERCOT shall apply, without exception, the same rules and requirements specified in these Protocols for the DAM, RUC and Adjustment Period and Real-Time markets that apply to Ancillary Services provided from any other Generation Resources. 
(a)	ERCOT systems shall determine the High and Low Ancillary Service Limits (HASL and LASL) for a Combined Cycle Generation Resource as follows:
(i)	In Real Time, relative to the telemetered High Sustained Limit (HSL) for the Combined Cycle Generation Resource, or
(ii)	During the DAM and RUC study periods, relative to the HSL in the COP.
(b)	The QSE shall assure that the Combined Cycle Generation Resource designated as On-Line through telemetry or in the COP can meet its Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility.

(a)	ERCOT systems shall determine the operating limits for a Combined Cycle Generation Resource as follows:
(i)	In Real-Time, relative to the telemetered capacity limits, ramp rates, and Ancillary Service capabilities for the Combined Cycle Generation Resource;
(ii)	During the DAM study period, relative to the HSL in the COP; or
(iii) 	During the RUC Study Period, relative to the capacity limits and Ancillary Service capabilities in the COP.
