3.7.1.2	Load Resource Parameters
(1)	Resource Parameters that may be modified, with documented reason for change, by the QSE for immediate use upon ERCOT validation, which may be adjusted to reflect Distribution Losses in accordance with Section 8.1.1.2, General Capacity Testing Requirements, include the following for each of its Load Resources that is a non-Controllable Load Resource:
(a)	Maximum interruption time;
(b)	Maximum daily deployments;
(c)	Maximum weekly deployments;
(d)	Maximum weekly energy;
(e)	Minimum notice time;
(f)	Minimum interruption time; and
(g)	Minimum restoration time.
(2)	Resource Parameters that may be modified, with documented reason for change, by the QSE for immediate use upon ERCOT validation, which may be adjusted to reflect Distribution Losses in accordance with Section 8.1.1.2, include the following for each of its Controllable Load Resources, including Aggregate Load Resources (ALRs):
(a)	Normal Ramp Rate curve;
(b)	Emergency Ramp Rate curve;
(c)	Maximum deployment time; and 
(d)	Maximum weekly energy.
(3)	Resource Parameters submitted by a Resource Entity must also include, for each of its ALRs, mapping between the ALR and the individually metered Loads, by Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID) or, in the case of a Non-Opt-In Entity (NOIE), equivalent unique meter identifier, comprising the ALR.
