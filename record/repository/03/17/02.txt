(2)	RRS is automatically self-deployed by Resources in a manner that results in real power increases or decreases.
(3)	RRS may be provided by:  
(a)	On-Line Generation Resource capable of providing Primary Frequency Response with the capacity excluding Non-Frequency Responsive Capacity (NFRC); 
(b)	Resources capable of providing Fast Frequency Response (FFR) and sustaining their response for up to 15 minutes; 
(c)	Load Resources controlled by high-set under-frequency relays; and
