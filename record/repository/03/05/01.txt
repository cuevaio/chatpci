3.5.1	Process for Defining Hubs
(1)	Hubs settled through ERCOT may only be created by an amendment to Section 3.5.2, Hub Definitions.  Hubs are made up of one or more Electrical Buses.  ERCOT shall post the list of Electrical Buses (including their names) that are part of a Hub on the ERCOT website.  A Hub, once defined, may not be modified except as explicitly described in the definition of that Hub. 
(2)	When any Electrical Bus within a Hub Bus is added to the Network Operations Model or the Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Network Model through changes to the Network Operations Model or CRR Network Model, ERCOT shall provide notice to all Market Participants as soon as practicable and include that Electrical Bus in the Hub Bus price calculation.
(3)	When any Electrical Bus within a Hub Bus is disconnected from the Network Operations Model or the CRR Network Model through operations changes in transmission topology temporarily, ERCOT shall provide notice to all Market Participants as soon as practicable and exclude that Electrical Bus from the Hub Bus price calculation.
(4)	In the event of a permanent change that removes the Hub Bus from the ERCOT Transmission Grid, ERCOT shall file a Nodal Protocol Revision Request (NPRR) to revise the appropriate Hub definition.  
(5)	If a Transmission Service Provider (TSP) or ERCOT plans a nomenclature change in the Network Operations Model or the CRR Network Model, ERCOT shall file a NPRR to include the nomenclature change in the Hub Bus definitions before implementing the name change to either the Network Operations Model or the CRR Network Model.
[NPRR857:  Replace paragraph (5) above with the following upon system implementation and satisfying the following conditions: (1) Southern Cross provides ERCOT with funds to cover the entire estimated cost of the project; and (2) Southern Cross has signed an interconnection agreement with a TSP and the TSP gives ERCOT written notice that Southern Cross has provided it with:  (a) Notice to proceed with the construction of the interconnection; and (b) The financial security required to fund the interconnection facilities:]
(5)	If a Transmission Service Provider (TSP), Direct Current Tie Operator (DCTO), or ERCOT plans a nomenclature change in the Network Operations Model or the CRR Network Model, ERCOT shall file a NPRR to include the nomenclature change in the Hub Bus definitions before implementing the name change to either the Network Operations Model or the CRR Network Model.
