3.20	Identification of Chronic Congestion
(1)	A constraint that has been binding in Real-Time on three or more Operating Days within a calendar month shall be considered to be experiencing chronic congestion.
3.20.1	Evaluation of Chronic Congestion
(1)	ERCOT shall evaluate chronic congestion monthly and shall report the results of its evaluation to the appropriate Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) subcommittee(s).  The report must identify the constraint(s) causing the chronic congestion.
3.20.2	Topology and Model Verification
(1)	For constraints identified in the report required by Section 3.20.1, Evaluation of Chronic Congestion, ERCOT shall notify the appropriate Transmission Service Provider(s) (TSP(s)) or Resource Entity.  The TSP or Resource Entity must verify that the data in the Network Operations Model and Updated Network Model is accurate, including the Ratings of the Transmission Facility causing the binding transmission constraint.
[NPRR857:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation and satisfying the following conditions: (1) Southern Cross provides ERCOT with funds to cover the entire estimated cost of the project; and (2) Southern Cross has signed an interconnection agreement with a TSP and the TSP gives ERCOT written notice that Southern Cross has provided it with:  (a) Notice to proceed with the construction of the interconnection; and (b) The financial security required to fund the interconnection facilities:]
(1)	For constraints identified in the report required by Section 3.20.1, Evaluation of Chronic Congestion, ERCOT shall notify the appropriate Transmission Service Provider(s) (TSP(s)), Direct Current Tie Operator (DCTO), or Resource Entity.  The TSP, DCTO, or Resource Entity must verify that the data in the Network Operations Model and Updated Network Model is accurate, including the Ratings of the Transmission Facility causing the binding transmission constraint.
(2)	If ERCOT determines that the Network Operations Model, the Updated Network Model, or the configuration of the Transmission Facility may be inaccurate, ERCOT shall coordinate with the owner of the Transmission Facility to determine if the Ratings should be updated, as provided by paragraph (3) of Section 3.10, Network Operations Modeling and Telemetry.
