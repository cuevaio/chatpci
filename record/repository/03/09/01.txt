3.9.1	Current Operating Plan (COP) Criteria
(1)	Each QSE that represents a Resource must submit a COP to ERCOT that reflects expected operating conditions for each Resource for each hour in the next seven Operating Days.
(2)	Each QSE that represents a Resource shall update its COP reflecting changes in availability of any Resource as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than 60 minutes after the event that caused the change.  Each QSE shall timely update its COP unless in the reasonable judgment of the QSE, such compliance would create an undue threat to safety, undue risk of bodily harm, or undue damage to equipment.  The QSE is excused from updating the COP only for so long as the undue threat to safety, undue risk of bodily harm, or undue damage to equipment exists.  The time for updating the COP begins once the undue threat to safety, undue risk of bodily harm, or undue damage to equipment no longer exists.
(3)	The Resource capacity in a QSE’s COP must be sufficient to supply the Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility of that QSE.  Additionally, for a COP provided for an ESR, the QSE shall ensure that the Hour Beginning Planned State of Charge (SOC) for any two consecutive hours shall be feasible based on the ESR’s maximum rate of charge or discharge.

(3)	Each QSE that represents a Resource shall update its COP to reflect the ability of the Resource to provide each Ancillary Service by product and sub-type.  Additionally, for a COP provided for an ESR, the QSE shall ensure that the Hour Beginning Planned State of Charge (SOC) for any two consecutive hours shall be feasible based on the ESR’s maximum rate of charge or discharge.

(a)	During a RUC study period, if a QSE’s COP reports multiple Combined Cycle Generation Resources in a Combined Cycle Train to be On-Line for any hour, then until the QSE corrects its COP, the On-Line Combined Cycle Generation Resource with the largest HSL is considered to be On-Line and all other Combined Cycle Generation Resources in the Combined Cycle Train are considered to be Off-Line.  Furthermore, until the QSE corrects its COP, the Off-Line Combined Cycle Generation Resources as designated through the application of this process are ineligible for RUC commitment or de-commitment Dispatch Instructions.
(b)	For any hour in which QSE-submitted COP entries are used to determine the initial state of a Combined Cycle Generation Resource for a DAM or Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC) study and the COP shows multiple Combined Cycle Generation Resources in a Combined Cycle Train to be in an On-Line Resource Status, then until the QSE corrects its COP, the On-Line Combined Cycle Generation Resource that has been On-Line for the longest time from the last recorded start by ERCOT systems, regardless of the reason for the start, combined with the COP Resource Status for the remaining hours of the current Operating Day, is considered to be On-Line at the start of the DRUC study period and all other COP-designated Combined Cycle Generation Resources in the Combined Cycle Train are considered to be Off-Line.
(c)	ERCOT systems shall allow only one Combined Cycle Generation Resource in a Combined Cycle Train to offer Off-Line Non-Spin in the DAM or Supplemental Ancillary Services Market (SASM).

(c)	ERCOT systems shall allow only one Combined Cycle Generation Resource in a Combined Cycle Train to offer Off-Line Non-Spin in the DAM or SCED.
(i)	If there are multiple Non-Spin offers from different Combined Cycle Generation Resources in a Combined Cycle Train, then prior to execution of the DAM, ERCOT shall select the Non-Spin offer from the Combined Cycle Generation Resource with the highest HSL for consideration in the DAM and ignore the other offers. 
(ii)	Combined Cycle Generation Resources offering Off-Line Non-Spin must be able to transition from the shutdown state to the offered Combined Cycle Generation Resource On-Line state and be capable of ramping to the full amount of the Non-Spin offered. 
(d)	The DAM and RUC shall honor the registered hot, intermediate or cold Startup Costs for each Combined Cycle Generation Resource registered in a Combined Cycle Train when determining the transition costs for a Combined Cycle Generation Resource.  In the DAM and RUC, the Startup Cost for a Combined Cycle Generation Resource shall be determined by the positive transition cost from the On-Line Combined Cycle Generation Resource within the Combine Cycle Train or from a shutdown condition, whichever ERCOT determines to be appropriate.
(7)	ERCOT may accept COPs only from QSEs.
(8)	For the first 168 hours of the COP, ERCOT will update the HSL values for Wind-powered Generation Resources (WGRs) with the most recently updated Short-Term Wind Power Forecast (STWPF), and the HSL values for PhotoVoltaic Generation Resources (PVGRs) with the most recently updated Short-Term PhotoVoltaic Power Forecast (STPPF).  ERCOT will notify the QSE via an Extensible Markup Language (XML) message each time COP HSL values are updated with the forecast values.  A QSE representing a WGR may override the STWPF HSL value but must submit an HSL value that is less than or equal to the amount for that Resource from the most recent STWPF provided by ERCOT; a QSE representing a PVGR may override the STPPF HSL value but must submit an HSL value that is less than or equal to the amount for that Resource from the most recent STPPF provided by ERCOT.  
[NPRR1029:  Replace paragraph (8) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(8)	For the first 168 hours of the COP, ERCOT will update the HSL values for Wind-powered Generation Resources (WGRs) with the most recently updated Short-Term Wind Power Forecast (STWPF), and the HSL values for PhotoVoltaic Generation Resources (PVGRs) with the most recently updated Short-Term PhotoVoltaic Power Forecast (STPPF).  A QSE representing a DC-Coupled Resource shall provide the capacity value of the Energy Storage System (ESS) that is included in the HSL of the DC-Coupled Resource, and ERCOT will update the DC-Coupled Resource’s HSL with the sum of the forecasts of the intermittent renewable generation component and the QSE-submitted value for the ESS component.  ERCOT will notify the QSE via an Extensible Markup Language (XML) message each time COP HSL values are updated with the forecast values.  A QSE representing a WGR may override the STWPF HSL value but must submit an HSL value that is less than or equal to the amount for that Resource from the most recent STWPF provided by ERCOT; a QSE representing a PVGR may override the STPPF HSL value but must submit an HSL value that is less than or equal to the amount for that Resource from the most recent STPPF provided by ERCOT.  A QSE representing a DC-Coupled Resource may override the COP HSL value with a value that is lower than the ERCOT-populated value, and may override with a value that is higher than the ERCOT-populated value if the ESS component of the DC-Coupled Resource can support the higher value.
(9)	A QSE representing a Generation Resource that is not actively providing Ancillary Services or is providing Off-Line Non-Spin that the Resource will provide following the shutdown, may only use a Resource Status of SHUTDOWN to indicate to ERCOT through telemetry that the Resource is operating in a shutdown sequence or a Resource Status of ONTEST to indicate in the COP and through telemetry that the Generation Resource is performing a test of its operations either manually dispatched by the QSE or by ERCOT as part of the test.  A QSE representing a Generation Resource that is not actively providing Ancillary Services may only use a Resource Status of STARTUP to indicate to ERCOT through telemetry that the Resource is operating in a start-up sequence requiring manual control and is not available for Dispatch.
(10)	If a QSE has not submitted a valid COP for any Generation Resource for any hour in the DAM or RUC Study Period, then the Generation Resource is considered to have a Resource Status as OUT thus not available for DAM awards or RUC commitments for those hours. 
(11)	If a COP is not available for any Resource for any hour from the current hour to the start of the DAM period or RUC study, then the Resource Status for those hours are considered equal to the last known Resource Status from a previous hour’s COP or from telemetry as appropriate for that Resource.
(12)	A QSE representing a Resource may only use the Resource Status code of EMR for a Resource whose operation would have impacts that cannot be monetized and reflected through the Resource’s Energy Offer Curve or recovered through the RUC make-whole process or if the Resource has been contracted by ERCOT under Section 3.14.1 or under paragraph (4) of Section 6.5.1.1.  If ERCOT chooses to commit an Off-Line unit with EMR Resource Status that has been contracted by ERCOT under Section 3.14.1 or under paragraph (4) of Section 6.5.1.1, the QSE shall change its Resource Status to ONRUC.  Otherwise, the QSE shall change its Resource Status to ONEMR.
(13)     A QSE representing a Resource may use the Resource Status code of ONEMR for a        Resource that is: 
(a)	On-Line, but for equipment problems it must be held at its current output level until repair and/or replacement of equipment can be accomplished; or
(b)	A hydro unit. 
(14)	A QSE operating a Resource with a Resource Status code of ONEMR may set the HSL and LSL of the unit to be equal to ensure that SCED does not send Base Points that would move the unit.
(15)	A QSE representing a Resource may use the Resource Status code of EMRSWGR only for an SWGR.
(16)	A QSE representing a Self-Limiting Facility must ensure that the sum of the COP HSL/LSL and the sum of the telemetered HSL/LSL submitted for each Resource within the Self-Limiting Facility do not exceed either the limit on MW Injection or the limit on the MW Withdrawal established for the Self-Limiting Facility.
[NPRR1029:  Insert paragraph (17) below upon system implementation and renumber accordingly:]
(17)	A QSE representing a DC-Coupled Resource shall not submit an HSL that exceeds the inverter rating or the sum of the nameplate ratings of the generation component(s) of the Resource.
(17)	A QSE representing an ESR shall ensure that COP values for a given hour follow the following rules:
(a)	MinSOC is greater than or equal to the nameplate minimum MWh operating SOC limit;
(b)	MaxSOC is less than or equal to the nameplate maximum MWh operating SOC limit; and
(c)	Hour Beginning Planned SOC is a value between the corresponding COP values of MinSOC and MaxSOC.
