3.2.3	Short-Term System Adequacy Reports
(1)	ERCOT shall generate and post short-term adequacy reports on the ERCOT website.  ERCOT shall update these reports hourly following updates to the Seven-Day Load Forecast, except where noted otherwise.  The short-term adequacy reports will provide:
(a)	For Generation Resources, the available On-Line Resource capacity for each hour, aggregated by Forecast Zone, using the COP for the first seven days and considering Resources with a COP Resource Status listed in paragraph (5)(b)(i) of Section 3.9.1, Current Operating Plan (COP) Criteria;
(b)	The total system-wide capacity of Resource Outages as reflected in the Outage Scheduler that are accepted or approved.  The Resource Outage capacity amount shall be based from each Resource’s current Seasonal High Sustained Limit (HSL) and posted each hour for the top of each Operating Hour for the next 168 hours.  This posted information will exclude specific Resource information and Outages related to Mothballed or Decommissioned Generation Resources, and will be aggregated on a Forecast Zone basis in three categories:
(i)	IRRs with an Outage Scheduler nature of work other than “New Equipment Energization”; 
(ii)	Other Resources with an Outage Scheduler nature of work other than “New Equipment Energization”; and
(iii)	Resources with an Outage Scheduler nature of work “New Equipment Energization”;
(c)	For Load Resources, the available capacity for each hour aggregated by Forecast Zone, using the COP for the first seven days and considering Resources with a COP Resource Status of ONRGL, ONCLR, or ONRL;
(d)	Forecast Demand for each hour described in Section 3.2.2, Demand Forecasts;
(e)	For Generation Resources, the available Off-Line Resource capacity that can be started for each hour, aggregated by Forecast Zone, using the COP for the first seven days and considering Resources with a COP Resource Status of OFF or OFFNS and temporal constraints;
(f)	Following each Hourly Reliability Unit Commitment (HRUC), the available On-Line capacity from Generation Resources, aggregated by Forecast Zone, based on Real-Time telemetry, for which the COP Resource Status is OFF, OUT, or EMR for all hours within the HRUC Study Period.  The available On-Line capacity will consider those Resources with a Real-Time Resource Status listed in paragraph (5)(b)(i) of Section 3.9.1 excluding SHUTDOWN;
(g)	The available capacity for each hour for the next seven days.  For day one, and for day two following the execution of the Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC) on day one, the available capacity will be the sum of the values calculated in paragraphs (a) and (e) above, except that for IRRs the forecasted output will be used instead of COP values, and Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) exports will be subtracted.  For the remaining hours of the seven days, the available capacity will be calculated as the sum of the Seasonal HSLs for non-IRR Generation Resources including seasonal Private Use Network capacity and the forecasted output for IRRs minus the total capacity of accepted or approved Resource Outages;
(h)	The available capacity for reserves for each hour, which will be the available capacity calculated in paragraph (g) above minus the forecasted Demand for that hour; and
(i)	For each DC Tie, the sum of any ERCOT-approved DC Tie Schedules for each 15-minute interval for the first seven days.  The sum shall be displayed as an absolute value and classified as a net import or net export. 
[NPRR1007 and NPRR1029:  Replace applicable portions of Section 3.2.3 above with the following upon system implementation for NPRR1029; or upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project for NPRR1007:]

The Resource Outage capacity amount shall be based from each Resource’s current Seasonal High Sustained Limit (HSL) and posted each hour for the top of each Operating Hour for the next 168 hours.  This posted information will exclude specific Resource information and Outages related to Mothballed or Decommissioned Generation Resources, and will be aggregated on a Forecast Zone basis in three categories:
(i)	IRRs and the intermittent renewable generation component of each DC-Coupled Resource with an Outage Scheduler nature of work other than “New Equipment Energization”; 
(ii)	Other Resources with an Outage Scheduler nature of work other than “New Equipment Energization”; and
(iii)	Resources with an Outage Scheduler nature of work “New Equipment Energization”;
(c)	For Load Resources, the available capacity for each hour aggregated by Forecast Zone, using the COP for the first seven days and considering Resources with a COP Resource Status of ONL;
(d)	The total capability of Resources available to provide the following Ancillary Service combinations, using COPs submitted by QSEs for the first seven days and capped by the COP limits for individual Resources.  A Resource’s capability shall only be included in the sums below if the Resource Status allows the Resource to provide at least one of the Ancillary Services within the sum:
(i)	Capacity to provide Reg-Up, irrespective of whether it is capable of providing any other Ancillary Service;
(ii)	Capacity to provide RRS, irrespective of whether it is capable of providing any other Ancillary Service;
(iii)	Capacity to provide ECRS, irrespective of whether it is capable of providing any other Ancillary Service;
(iv)	Capacity to provide Non-Spin, irrespective of whether it is capable of providing any other Ancillary Service;
(v)	Capacity to provide Reg-Up, RRS, or both, irrespective of whether it is capable of providing ECRS or Non-Spin;
(vi)	Capacity to provide Reg-Up, RRS, ECRS, or any combination, irrespective of whether it is capable of providing Non-Spin;
(vii)	Capacity to provide Reg-Up, RRS, ECRS, Non-Spin, or any combination; and
(viii)	Capacity to provide Reg-Down;
(e)	Forecast Demand for each hour described in Section 3.2.2, Demand Forecasts;
(f)	For Generation Resources, the available Off-Line Resource capacity that can be started for each hour, aggregated by Forecast Zone, using the COP for the first seven days and considering Resources with a COP Resource Status of OFF and temporal constraints; 
(g)	Following each Hourly Reliability Unit Commitment (HRUC), the available On-Line capacity from Generation Resources, aggregated by Forecast Zone, based on Real-Time telemetry, for which the COP Resource Status is OFF, OUT, or EMR for all hours within the HRUC Study Period.  The available On-Line capacity will consider those Resources with a Real-Time Resource Status listed in paragraph (5)(b)(i) of Section 3.9.1 excluding SHUTDOWN; 
(h)	For each Direct Current Tie (DC Tie), the sum of any ERCOT-approved DC Tie Schedules for each 15-minute interval for the first seven days.  The sum shall be displayed as an absolute value and classified as a net import or net export; 
(i)	The available capacity for each hour for the next seven days.  For day one, and for day two following the execution of the Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC) on day one, the available capacity will be the sum of the values calculated in paragraphs (a) and (f) above, except that for IRRs the forecasted output will be used instead of COP values, and DC Tie exports will be subtracted.  For the remaining hours of the seven days, the available capacity will be calculated as the sum of the Seasonal HSLs for non-IRR Generation Resources including seasonal Private Use Network capacity and the forecasted output for IRRs minus the total capacity of accepted or approved Resource Outages; and
(j)	The available capacity for reserves for each hour, which will be the available capacity calculated in paragraph (i) above minus the forecasted Demand for that hour.
