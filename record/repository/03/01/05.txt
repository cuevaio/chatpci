3.1.5	Transmission System Outages
3.1.5.1	ERCOT Evaluation of Planned Outage and Maintenance Outage of Transmission Facilities
(1)	A TSP or Resource Entity shall request a Planned Outage or Maintenance Outage when any Transmission Facility that is part of the ERCOT Transmission Grid and defined in the Network Operations Model will be removed from its normal service.  For Resource Entities within a Private Use Network, this only includes Transmission Facilities at the Point of Interconnection (POI).  For TSP requests, the TSPs shall enter such requests in the Outage Scheduler.  For Resource Entity requests, the Resource Entity shall enter such requests in the Outage Scheduler.  Planned Outages, Maintenance Outages, or Rescheduled Outages for Electrical Buses will be treated as consequentially outaged Transmission Elements.  In those cases where a TSP enters the breaker and switch statuses associated with an Electrical Bus, a downstream topology processor will evaluate the breakers and switches associated with the applicable Electrical Bus to determine if the Electrical Bus is consequentially outaged, and to thereby designate the status of the Electrical Bus.  Proposed Transmission Planned Outage or Maintenance Outage information submitted by a TSP or Resource Entity in accordance with this Section constitutes a request for ERCOT’s approval of the Outage Schedule associated with the Planned Outage or Maintenance Outage.  ERCOT is not deemed to have approved the Outage Schedule associated with the Planned Outage or Maintenance Outage until ERCOT notifies the TSP or Resource Entity of its approval under procedures adopted by ERCOT.  ERCOT shall evaluate requests under Section 3.1.5.11, Evaluation of Transmission Facilities Planned Outage or Maintenance Outage Requests.

(1)	A TSP, DCTO, or Resource Entity shall request a Planned Outage or Maintenance Outage when any Transmission Facility that is part of the ERCOT Transmission Grid and defined in the Network Operations Model will be removed from its normal service.  For Resource Entities within a Private Use Network, this only includes Transmission Facilities at the Point of Interconnection (POI).  For TSP, DCTO, and Resource Entity requests, the requesting Entity shall enter such a request in the Outage Scheduler.  Planned Outages, Maintenance Outages, or Rescheduled Outages for Electrical Buses will be treated as consequentially outaged Transmission Elements.  In those cases where a TSP or DCTO enters the breaker and switch statuses associated with an Electrical Bus, a downstream topology processor will evaluate the breakers and switches associated with the applicable Electrical Bus to determine if the Electrical Bus is consequentially outaged, and to thereby designate the status of the Electrical Bus.  Proposed Transmission Planned Outage or Maintenance Outage information submitted by a TSP, DCTO, or Resource Entity in accordance with this Section constitutes a request for ERCOT’s approval of the Outage Schedule associated with the Planned Outage or Maintenance Outage.  ERCOT is not deemed to have approved the Outage Schedule associated with the Planned Outage or Maintenance Outage until ERCOT notifies the TSP, DCTO, or Resource Entity of its approval under procedures adopted by ERCOT.  ERCOT shall evaluate requests under Section 3.1.5.11, Evaluation of Transmission Facilities Planned Outage or Maintenance Outage Requests.
(2)	ERCOT shall review and approve Planned Outages and Maintenance Outages of Transmission Facilities schedules.  ERCOT shall transmit its approvals and rejections to TSPs via the ERCOT Outage Scheduler.

Once approved, ERCOT may not withdraw its approval except under the conditions described in Section 3.1.5.7, Withdrawal of Approval of Approved Planned Outages, Maintenance Outages, and Rescheduled Outages of Transmission Facilities.
(3)	Private Use Network Outage requests submitted pursuant to this Section shall not be publicly posted.
(4)	To the extent authorized by its tariff, an External Load Serving Entity (ELSE) or Non-Opt-In Entity (NOIE) that provides retail service to a Resource Entity that owns or operates a Generation Resource may request that the TSP to which the Generation Resource is interconnected disconnect the Generation Resource due to the Resource Entity’s failure to comply with the payment requirements in the ELSE’s or NOIE’s retail tariff.  
(5)	Within five Business Days after receiving a request from a Load Serving Entity (LSE) to disconnect a Generation Resource due to the Resource Entity’s failure to comply with LSE’s payment requirements, including a request received pursuant to paragraph (4) above, the interconnecting TSP shall enter a request in the Outage Scheduler for an Outage of any Transmission Facilities interconnecting the Generation Resource to the ERCOT System.  Any Outage requested or taken pursuant to this Section shall be treated as a Planned Outage for all purposes under the Protocols.  For any such Outage request, the requesting TSP shall enter a start date that it is at least four days after the date the request is submitted in the Outage Scheduler and shall enter an Outage end date that is 14 days from the date of the requested start date.  Unless storm or system reliability issues prevent immediate dispatch of personnel, for any LSE request to reconnect a Customer that was disconnected pursuant to this section, the interconnecting TSP shall end the Outage and reconnect the Generation Resource the same Business Day if the request is received by 1200, or the next Business Day if the request is received after 1200.  If a reconnect request is not received within four days of the Outage end date, the interconnecting TSP shall enter another request in the Outage Scheduler for an Outage of any Transmission Facilities interconnecting the Generation Resource to the ERCOT System with an Outage end date 14 days beyond the prior Outage end date.  At any time, ERCOT may withdraw approval of the Outage and instruct the TSP to reconnect the Generation Resource if it deems cancellation necessary to address reliability concerns.
