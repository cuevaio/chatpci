5.6.2	RUC Startup Cost Eligibility
(1)	For purposes of this Section 5.6.2, all contiguous RUC-Committed Hours are considered as one RUC instruction.  For each Resource, only one Startup Cost is eligible per block of contiguous RUC-Committed Hours.
(2)	For a Resource’s Startup Costs in the Operating Day, per RUC instruction, to be included in the calculation of the RUC guarantee for that Operating Day, all the criteria below must be met: 
(a)	According to the Current Operating Plan (COP) and Trades Snapshot for the RUC process that committed the Resource, the Resource must not be QSE-committed in the Settlement Interval immediately before the designated start hour or after the last hour of the RUC instruction;
[NPRR1009:  Replace paragraph (a) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]
(a)	According to the RUC Snapshot for the RUC process that committed the Resource, the Resource must not be QSE-committed in the Settlement Interval immediately before the designated start hour or after the last hour of the RUC instruction;
(b)	A later RUC instruction or QSE commitment must not connect the designated start hour or last hour of the RUC instruction to a block of QSE-committed Intervals that was QSE-committed before the RUC instruction was given, according to the COP and Trades Snapshot for the RUC process that committed the Resource;
[NPRR1009:  Replace paragraph (b) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]
(b)	A later RUC instruction or QSE commitment must not connect the designated start hour or last hour of the RUC instruction to a block of QSE-committed Intervals that was QSE-committed before the RUC instruction was given, according to the RUC Snapshot for the RUC process that committed the Resource;
(c)	The generation breakers must have been open, as indicated by a telemetered Resource Status of Off-Line, for at least five minutes during the six hours preceding the first RUC-Committed Hour; and
(d)	The generation breakers must have been closed, as indicated by a telemetered Resource Status of On-Line, for at least one minute during the RUC commitment period or after the determined five-minute open breaker, as indicated by a telemetered Resource Status of Off-Line, in the six hours preceding the first RUC-Committed Hour.
(3)	Notwithstanding paragraphs (2)(c) and (2)(d) above, the QSE of a RUC-committed Resource may submit a Settlement dispute for a Resource’s Startup Costs in the Operating Day, per RUC instruction, to be included in the calculation of the RUC guarantee for that Operating Day if the startup time for the RUC-committed Resource is greater than six hours.  The dispute is subject to verification and approval by ERCOT based on the criteria below:
(a)	The generation breakers must have been open, as indicated by a telemetered Resource Status of Off-Line, for at least five minutes between the time the QSE is notified of the RUC instruction and the first RUC-Committed Hour;
(b)	The generation breakers must have been closed, as indicated by a telemetered Resource Status of On-Line, for at least one minute during the RUC commitment period or after the five-minute open breaker determined in item (a) above;
(c)	The breaker open-close sequence from items (a) and (b) above does not make the Resource eligible for Startup Cost compensation in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) or for any other contiguous block of RUC-Committed Hours; and
(d)	The startup time used to process the dispute will be the startup time considered by the ERCOT Operator at the time the RUC instruction was issued.
(4)	For purposes of this Section 5.6.2, the telemetered Resource Status of OFFQS shall be considered as Off-Line.
(5)	A Resource that has a Three-Part Supply Offer cleared in the DAM and subsequently receives a RUC commitment for the Operating Hour for which it was awarded will be settled in accordance with Section 4.6.2.3, Day-Ahead Make-Whole Settlements.
