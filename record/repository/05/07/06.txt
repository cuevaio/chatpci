5.7.6	RUC Decommitment Charge 
(1)	ERCOT shall charge each QSE a RUC Decommitment Charge, on an LRS basis, all revenues paid as a result of RUC Decommitment Payments, including amounts for RMR Units.  The RUC Decommitment Charge for a 15-minute Settlement Interval is calculated as follows:
LARUCDCAMTq,i	=	(-1) * [(RUCDCAMTTOTh / 4) * LRSq,i]
      Where:
	RUCDCAMTTOTh	=	RUCDCAMTq,r,h
The above variables are defined as follows:
