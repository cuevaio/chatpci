5.7.2	RUC Clawback Charge
(1)	A QSE for a Resource shall pay a RUC Clawback Charge for the Operating Day if the RUC Guarantee is less than the sum of:
(a)	RUC Minimum-Energy Revenue calculated in Section 5.7.1.2, RUC Minimum-Energy Revenue;
(b)	Revenue Less Cost Above LSL During RUC-Committed Hours calculated in Section 5.7.1.3, Revenue Less Cost Above LSL During RUC-Committed Hours; and 
(c)	Revenue Less Cost During QSE-Clawback Intervals calculated in Section 5.7.1.4, Revenue Less Cost During QSE Clawback Intervals. 
(2)	The amount of the RUC Clawback Charge is 100% of the difference calculated in paragraph (1) above.
[NPRR1172:  Delete paragraph (2) above upon system implementation and renumber accordingly.]
(3)	The RUC Clawback Charge for a Resource, including RMR Units, for each Operating Day is allocated evenly over the RUC-Committed Hours for that Resource.  
[NPRR1014:  Insert paragraph (4) below upon system implementation and renumber accordingly:]
(4)	Energy Storage Resources (ESRs) are not subject to RUC Clawback Charges. 
(4)	For each RUC-committed Resource, the RUC Clawback Charge for each RUC-Committed Hour of the Operating Day is calculated as follows:
If (RUCMEREV q, r, d + RUCEXRR q, r, d – RUCACREV q, r, d – RUCG q, r, d) > 0, 
Then,
RUCCBAMT q, r, h	=	[(RUCMEREV q, r, d + RUCEXRR q, r, d – RUCACREV q, r, d – RUCG q, r, d) * RUCCBFR q, r, d + RUCEXRQC q, r, d * RUCCBFC q, r, d] / RUCHR q, r, d
