5.7.1.1	RUC Guarantee
(1)	The allowable Startup Costs and minimum-energy costs of a Resource committed by RUC is the RUC Guarantee.  The RUC Guarantee minimum-energy costs are prorated according to the actual generation when the Resource’s average output during a 15-minute Settlement Interval is below the corresponding LSL.
(2)	The SUPR, MEPR and LSL used to calculate the RUC Guarantee for a Combined Cycle Train are the SUPR, MEPR and LSL that correspond to the Combined Cycle Generation Resource, within the Combined Cycle Train, that is RUC-committed for the hour.  If the RUC-Committed Interval is a RUC for Additional Capacity (RUCAC)-Interval, then the SUPR, MEPR, and LSL that corresponds to the QSE-committed Combined Cycle Generation Resource is also used to calculate RUC Guarantee for a Combined Cycle Train.
(3)	For an Aggregate Generation Resource (AGR), the Startup Cost shall be scaled according to the maximum number of its generators online during a contiguous block of RUC-committed intervals, as indicated by telemetry, compared to the total number of generators registered to the AGR and used in the approved verifiable cost for the AGR.
(4)	The RUC Guarantee is calculated for non-Combined Cycle Trains as follows: 
RUCG q, r, d	=	 (SUPR q, r, s * RUCSUFLAG q, r, s) + (MEPR q, r, i * Min ((LSL q, r, i * (¼)), RTMG q, r, i))
(5)	The RUC Guarantee is calculated for Combined Cycle Trains as follows:
RUCG q, r, d	=	(SUPR q, r, s * RUCSUFLAG q, r, s) + 
		(MAX (0, SUPR - SUPR)) + (RUCGME q, r, i)
      Where,
	If a Combined Cycle Train transitions to a RUC-committed configuration from a QSE-committed or other RUC-committed configuration between two contiguous hours, or to a RUC-committed configuration from a QSE-committed configuration within the same hour due to a RUCAC, the transition is calculated as follows:
MAX (0, SUPR afterCCGR – SUPR beforeCCGR)
	If a Combined Cycle Train transitions to a QSE-committed configuration from a RUC-committed configuration, the transition is calculated as follows:
MAX (0, SUPR beforeCCGR – SUPR afterCCGR)
If the interval i is a RUC-Committed Interval that is not a RUCAC, then:
RUCGME q, r, i	=  MEPR q, r, i * Min ((LSL q, r, i * (¼)), RTMG q, r, i)
If the interval i is a RUCAC of a previously QSE-Committed Interval, then:
RUCGME q, r, i	=  Max [0, MEPR q, afterCCGR, i * Min ((LSL q, afterCCGR, i * 
		(¼)), RTMG q, r, i) – MEPR q, beforeCCGR, i * (LSL q, beforeCCGR, i * (¼))]
(6)	If a validated Three-Part Supply Offer has been submitted for a Resource for the RUC, then the RUC Guarantee for that Resource is based on the minimum of the Startup Offer in that validated Three-Part Supply Offer and Startup Cap and the lesser of the Minimum-Energy Offer in that validated Three-Part Supply Offer and the Minimum-Energy Offer Cap.  If a validated Three-Part Supply Offer has not been submitted for a Resource for the RUC and ERCOT has not yet approved verifiable unit-specific costs for the Resource, then the RUC Guarantee for a Resource is based on the Resource Category Startup Generic Cap and the Resource Category Minimum-Energy Generic Cap.  If a validated Three-Part Supply Offer has not been submitted for a Resource for the RUC and ERCOT has approved verifiable unit-specific costs for the Resource, then the RUC Guarantee for a Resource is based on the most recent ERCOT-approved verifiable unit-specific costs for that Resource.
For a Resource which is not an AGR, 
If the QSE submitted a validated Three-Part Supply Offer, 
	Then, 		SUPR q, r, s	=	Min (SUO q, r, s, SUCAP q, r, s)
			MEPR q, r, i	=	Min (MEO q, r, i, MECAP q, r, i)
	Otherwise, 	SUPR q, r, s 	= 	SUCAP q, r, s
			MEPR q, r, i 	= 	MECAP q, r, i
If ERCOT has approved verifiable Startup Costs and minimum-energy costs for the Resource,
	Then, 		SUCAP q, r, s	=	verifiable Startup Costs q, r, s
			MECAP q, r, i	=	verifiable minimum-energy costs q, r, i
	Otherwise, 	SUCAP q, r, s 	= 	RCGSC s
			MECAP q, r, i	= 	RCGMEC i
For AGRs,
If the QSE submitted a validated Three-Part Supply Offer, 
Then, 		SUPR  q, r, s	=	Min (SUO q, r, s, SUCAP q, r, s)
			MEPR q, r, i	=	Min (MEO q, r, i, MECAP q, r, i)
	Otherwise, 	SUPR q, r, s 	= 	SUCAP q, r, s
			MEPR q, r, i 	= 	MECAP q, r, i
If ERCOT has approved verifiable Startup Costs and minimum-energy costs for the Resource,
	Then, 		SUCAP q, r, s	=	Max c (AGRRATIO q, p, r) * verifiable Startup Costs q, r, s
			MECAP q, r, i	=	verifiable minimum-energy costs q, r, i
	Where, 		AGRRATIO q, p, r	 =	AGRMAXON q, p, r / AGRTOT q, p, r
	Otherwise, 	SUCAP q, r, s 	= 	Max c (AGRRATIO q, p, r) * RCGSC s

5.7.1.4	Revenue Less Cost During QSE Clawback Intervals
(1)	The total revenue for a Resource less the cost based on the Energy Offer Curve Cost Cap as described in Section 4.4.9.3.3, Energy Offer Curve Cost Caps, during all QSE Clawback Intervals of the Operating Day is Revenue Less Cost During QSE-Clawback Intervals. 
(2)	The MEPR and LSL used to calculate Revenue Less Cost During QSE Clawback Intervals for a Combined Cycle Train is the MEPR and LSL that corresponds to the Combined Cycle Generation Resource, within a Combined Cycle Train, that operates in Real-Time for the QSE Clawback Interval.
(3)	For each QSE Clawback Interval, Revenue Less Cost During QSE Clawback Intervals is calculated as follows:
RUCEXRQC q, r, d		=  Max {0, [(RTSPP p, i * RTMG q, r, i)
+ (-1) * (VSSVARAMT q, r, i + VSSEAMT q, r, i)
			+ (-1) * EMREAMT q, r, i
			– [MEPR q, r, i * Min (RTMG q, r, i, (LSL q, r, i * (¼)))] 
			– [RTEOCOST q, r, i * Max (0, RTMG q, r, i – (LSL q, r, i * (¼)))]]}  
If the QSE submitted a validated Three-Part Supply Offer for the Resource, 
	Then, 		MEPR q, r, i	=	Min (MEO q, r, i, MECAP q, r, i)
	Otherwise, 	MEPR q, r, i 	= 	MECAP q, r, i
If ERCOT has approved verifiable minimum-energy costs for the Resource,
	Then,		MECAP q, r, i	=	verifiable minimum-energy costs q, r, i
	Otherwise, 	MECAP q, r, i	= 	RCGMEC i
[NPRR1009 and NPRR1014:  Replace applicable portions of the formula “RUCEXRQC q, r, d” above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project for NPRR1009; or upon system implementation for NPRR1014:]
RUCEXRQC q, r, d		=  Max {0, [(RTSPP p, i * RTMG q, r, i)
			+ RTASREVq, r, i
			+ (-1) * (VSSVARAMT q, r, i + VSSEAMT q, r, i)
		   + (-1) * EMREAMT q, r, i
		   – [MEPR q, r, i * Min (RTMG q, r, i, (LSL q, r, i * (¼)))] 
		   – [RTEOCOST q, r, i * Max (0, RTMG q, r, i – (LSL q, r, i * (¼)))]]}  
If the QSE submitted a validated Three-Part Supply Offer for the Resource, 
	Then, 		MEPR q, r, i	=	Min (MEO q, r, i, MECAP q, r, i)
	Otherwise, 	MEPR q, r, i 	= 	MECAP q, r, i
If ERCOT has approved verifiable minimum-energy costs for the Resource,
	Then,		MECAP q, r, i	=	verifiable minimum-energy costs q, r, i
	Otherwise, 	MECAP q, r, i	= 	RCGMEC i
Where, 
RTASREV q, r, i = RTRUREV q, r, i + RTRDREV q, r, i + RTRRREV q, r, i + RTECRREV q, r, i  +  RTNSREV q, r, i
