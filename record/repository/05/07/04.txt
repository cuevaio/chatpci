5.7.4	RUC Make-Whole Charges 
(1)	All QSEs that were capacity-short in each RUC will be charged for that shortage, as described in Section 5.7.4.1, RUC Capacity-Short Charge.  If the revenues from the charges under Section 5.7.4.1 are not enough to cover all RUC Make-Whole Payments for a Settlement Interval, then the difference will be uplifted to all QSEs on a Load Ratio Share (LRS) basis, as described in Section 5.7.4.2, RUC Make-Whole Uplift Charge.
(2)	On a monthly basis, within ten days after the Initial Settlement of the last day of the month has been completed, ERCOT shall post on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area the total RUC Make-Whole Charges and RUC Clawback Payment Amounts, by Settlement Interval, by QSE capacity-shortfall and by amount uplifted. 
5.7.4.1	RUC Capacity-Short Charge
(1)	The dollar amount charged to each QSE, due to capacity shortfalls for a particular RUC, for a 15-minute Settlement Interval, is the QSE’s shortfall ratio share multiplied by the total RUC Make-Whole Payments, including amounts for RMR Units, to all QSEs for that RUC, subject to a cap.  The cap on the charge to each QSE is two multiplied by the total RUC Make-Whole Payments, including amounts for RMR Units, for all QSEs multiplied by that QSE’s capacity shortfall for that RUC process divided by the total capacity of all RUC-committed Resources during that Settlement Interval for the RUC process.  That dollar amount charged to each QSE is calculated as follows:
RUCCSAMT ruc, i, q	=	(-1) * Max [(RUCSFRS ruc, i, q * RUCMWAMTRUCTOT ruc, h), 
(2 * RUCSF ruc, i, q * RUCMWAMTRUCTOT ruc, h / RUCCAPTOT ruc, h)] / 4
Where:
RUCMWAMTRUCTOT ruc, h 	=	RUCMWAMT ruc, q, r, h
RUCCAPTOT ruc, h	    	 =	(RUCHSL ruc, h, r – RUCHSL ruc, h, beforeCCGR)

For an IRR, the HASLSNAP variable used below shall be equal to the minimum of the WGRPP or PVGRPP described above and the HSL value as reflected in the QSE’s COP, at the time of the RUC execution.  
(2)	In calculating the amount short for each QSE, the QSE must be given a capacity credit for non-Intermittent Renewable Resources (IRRs) that were given notice of decommitment within the two hours before the Operating Hour as a result of the RUC process by setting the HASLSNAP and HASLADJ variables used below equal to the HASLSNAP value for the Resource immediately before the decommitment instruction was given.  
(3)	In calculating the short amount for each QSE, if the High Ancillary Service Limit (HASL) for a Resource was credited to the QSE during the RUC snapshot but the Resource experiences a Forced Outage within two hours before the start of the Settlement Interval, then the HASL for that Resource is also credited to the QSE in the HASLADJ.
(4)	In calculating the short amount for each QSE, if the DCIMPSNAP was credited to the QSE during the RUC snapshot but the entire Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) experiences a Forced Outage within two hours before the start of the Settlement Interval, then the DCIMPSNAP is also credited to the QSE in the DCIMPADJ.
(5)	For Combined Cycle Generation Resources, if more than one Combined Cycle Generation Resource is shown On-Line in its COP for the same Settlement hour, then the provisions of paragraph (6)(a) of Section 3.9.1, Current Operating Plan (COP) Criteria, apply in the determination of the On-Line Combined Cycle Generation Resource for that Settlement hour.

5.7.4.1.1	Capacity Shortfall Ratio Share
(1)	In calculating the shortfall amount for each QSE, the Resource capacity shall be calculated for a Generation Resource or ESR that meets any of the following conditions: 
      (a)	QSE-committed;  
(b)	Planning to operate as a Quick Start Generation Resource (QSGR) for the Settlement Interval as shown by the COP Status of OFFQS in the RUC Snapshot for the RUC Process and/or Adjustment Period; or
(c)	A Switchable Generation Resource (SWGR) that is released by a non-ERCOT Control Area Operator (CAO) to operate in the ERCOT Control Area due to an ERCOT RUC instruction for an actual or anticipated EEA condition and that is shown as On-Line in its COP; or 
(d)	If the Settlement Interval is a RUCAC-Interval, the Combined Cycle Generation Resource that was QSE-committed at the time the RUCAC was issued, excluding the condition for SWGRs as describe in paragraph (c) above.
(2)	In calculating the amount short for each QSE, the available capacity of an IRR when determining responsibility for the corresponding RUC charges shall be the lessor of the HSL value, as reflected in the COP, and the Wind-powered Generation Resource Production Potential (WGRPP), as described in Section 4.2.2, Wind-Powered Generation Resource Production Potential, for a Wind-powered Generation Resource (WGR), or the PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource Production Potential (PVGRPP), as described in Section 4.2.3, PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource Production Potential, for a PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource (PVGR), at the time of RUC execution.  For an IRR, the RCAPSNAP variable used below shall be equal to the minimum of the WGRPP or PVGRPP described above and the HSL value as reflected in the QSE’s COP, at the time of the RUC execution. 
(3)	In calculating the amount short for each QSE, the QSE must be given a capacity credit for non-Intermittent Renewable Resources (IRRs) that were given notice of decommitment within the two hours before the Operating Hour as a result of the RUC process by setting the RCAPSNAP and RCAPADJ variables used below set equal to the RCAPSNAP value for the Resource immediately before the decommitment instruction was given.
(4)	In calculating the short amount for each QSE, if the RCAPSNAP for a non-IRR was credited to the QSE during the RUC Snapshot but the Resource experiences a Forced Outage within two hours before the start of the Settlement Interval, then the RCAPSNAP for that Resource is also credited to the QSE in the RCAPADJ.
(5)	In calculating the short amount for each QSE, if the DCIMPSNAP was credited to the QSE during the RUC Snapshot but the entire Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) experiences a Forced Outage within two hours before the start of the Settlement Interval, then the DCIMPSNAP is also credited to the QSE in the RTDCIMP.
(6)	For Combined Cycle Generation Resources, if more than one Combined Cycle Generation Resource is shown On-Line in its COP for the same Settlement hour, then the provisions of paragraph (6)(a) of Section 3.9.1, Current Operating Plan (COP) Criteria, apply in the determination of the On-Line Combined Cycle Generation Resource for that Settlement hour.
(7)	The capacity shortfall ratio share of a specific QSE for a particular RUC process is calculated, for a 15-minute Settlement Interval, as follows:
RUCSFRS ruc, i, q	=	RUCSF ruc, i, q / RUCSFTOT ruc, i
      Where:
RUCSFTOT ruc, i	=	RUCSF ruc, i, q
(8)	The RUC Shortfall in MW for one QSE for one 15-minute Settlement Interval is:
RUCSF ruc, i, q	=	Max (0, Max (RUCSFSNAP ruc, q, i, RUCSFADJ ruc, q, i) – RUCCAPCREDIT q, i, z)
(9)	The RUC Shortfall in MW for one QSE for one 15-minute Settlement Interval, as measured at the RUC Snapshot, is:
RUCSFSNAP ruc ,q ,i	=	Max (RUCOSFSNAP ruc, q, i , RUCASFSNAP ruc, q, i)
(10)	The overall shortfall in MW that a QSE had according to the RUC Snapshot for a 15-minute Settlement Interval is:
RUCOSFSNAP ruc, q, i   =  Max (0, ((RTAML q, p, i * 4) + ASONPOSSNAP ruc, q, i  – RUCCAPSNAP ruc, q, i))
The QSE’s On-Line Ancillary Service Position according to the RUC Snapshot for a 15-minute Settlement Interval is:
ASONPOSSNAP ruc, q, i   =  RUPOSSNAP ruc, q, h  + RRPOSSNAP ruc, q, h +                                  Max (0, (ECRPOSSNAP ruc, q, h + NSPOSSNAP ruc, q, h –                  ASOFFOFRSNAP ruc, q, r, h))
	The amount of capacity that a QSE had according to the RUC Snapshot for a 15-minute Settlement Interval is:
RUCCAPSNAP ruc, q, i =	RCAPSNAP ruc, q, r, h + (RUCCPSNAP ruc, q, h – RUCCSSNAP ruc, q, h) + (DAEP q, p, h –DAES q, p, h) + (RTQQEPSNAP ruc, q, p, i – RTQQESSNAP ruc, q, p, i) +   DCIMPSNAP ruc, q, p, i + ASOFRLRSNAP ruc, q, r, h
(11)	The Ancillary Service shortfall calculation compares the Ancillary Service capability of the QSE, measured by the submitted Ancillary Service Offers, to the Ancillary Service Position.  Because the same Resource capacity can be represented in Ancillary Offers for multiple products, the aggregated capability is accounted for by grouping Ancillary Service types in the calculation below.  The Ancillary Service shortfall in MW that a QSE had according to the RUC Snapshot for a 15-minute Settlement Interval is:
RUCASFSNAP ruc, q, i   =  Max (0, ASCAP1SNAP ruc, q, i , ASCAP2SNAP ruc, q, i, ASCAP3SNAP ruc, q, i , ASCAP4SNAP ruc, q, i, ASCAP5SNAP ruc, q, i) + Max (0, ASCAP6SNAP ruc, q, i)
Where:
ASCAP1SNAP ruc, q, i   =  RUPOSSNAP ruc, q, h – ASOFR1SNAP ruc, q, r, h
ASCAP2SNAP ruc, q, i   =  RRPOSSNAPruc, q, h –  ASOFR2SNAP ruc, q, r, h

ASCAP6SNAP ruc, q, i  =  RDPOSSNAP ruc, q, h – ASOFR6SNAP ruc, q, r, h
(12)	The RUC Shortfall in MW for one QSE for one 15-minute Settlement Interval, as measured at the end of the Adjustment Period, is:
RUCSFADJ ruc, q, i	=	Max (RUCOSFADJ ruc, q, i, RUCASFADJ q, i )
(13)	The overall shortfall in MW that a QSE had at the end of the Adjustment Period for a 15-minute Settlement Interval, but including capacity from IRRs as seen in the RUC Snapshot, is:
RUCOSFADJ ruc, q, i  = Max (0, ((RTAML q, p, i *4) + ASONPOSADJ q, i – (RCAPSNAP ruc, q, r, h + RUCCAPADJ q, i)))
Where:
The On-Line Ancillary Service Position the QSE had at the end of the Adjustment Period for a 15-minute Settlement Interval is:
ASONPOSADJ q ,i   =  RUPOSADJ q, h  + RRPOSADJ q, h +  Max (0, (ECRPOSADJ q, h + NSPOSADJ q,h – ASOFFOFRADJ  q, r, h ))
	The amount of capacity that a QSE had at the end of the Adjustment Period for a 15-minute Settlement Interval, excluding capacity from IRRs, is:

(14)	The Ancillary Service shortfall calculation compares the Ancillary Service capability of the QSE, measured by the submitted Ancillary Service Offers, to the Ancillary Service Position.  Because the same Resource capacity can be represented in Ancillary Offers for multiple products, the aggregated capability is accounted for by grouping Ancillary Service types in the calculation below.  The Ancillary Service shortfall in MW that a QSE had at the end of the Adjustment Period for a 15-minute Settlement Interval is:
RUCASFADJ q, i   =  Max (0, ASCAP1ADJ q, i , ASCAP2ADJ q, i , ASCAP3ADJ q, i , ASCAP4ADJ q, i , ASCAP5ADJ q, i) + Max (0, ASCAP6ADJ q, i )
Where:
