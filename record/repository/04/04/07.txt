4.4.7.1	Self-Arranged Ancillary Service Quantities
(1)	For each Ancillary Service, a QSE may self-arrange all or a portion of the Ancillary Service Obligation allocated to it by ERCOT.  QSEs may not self-arrange Regulation Service amounts that include Fast Responding Regulation Up Service (FRRS-Up) or Fast Responding Regulation Down Service (FRRS-Down) quantities.  In addition, a QSE may self-arrange up to 100 MW of ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service (ECRS), 100 MW of Responsive Reserve (RRS), 25 MW of Regulation Up Service (Reg-Up), 25 MW of Regulation Down Service (Reg-Down), and 50 MW of Non-Spinning Reserve (Non-Spin) in excess of its corresponding Ancillary Service Obligation, provided that the amount self-arranged from the QSE’s Resources for a given Ancillary Service shall not exceed the amount of the QSE’s Ancillary Services Obligation for that Ancillary Service.  If a QSE elects to self-arrange Ancillary Service capacity, then ERCOT shall not pay the QSE for the Self-Arranged Ancillary Service Quantities for the portion that meets its Ancillary Service Obligation.  Any Self-Arranged Ancillary Service Quantities in excess of a QSE’s Ancillary Service Obligation will be considered to be offered in the DAM or Supplemental Ancillary Services Market (SASM), as applicable, for $0/MWh.

(2)	An Ancillary Service Trade that is reported to ERCOT by 1430 in the Day-Ahead changes the Ancillary Service Position of the buyer and seller in the DRUC process.  An Ancillary Service Trade that is reported to ERCOT after 1430 in the Day-Ahead changes the Ancillary Service Position of the buyer and seller in any applicable HRUC process, the deadline for which is after the trade is submitted.
(3)	As soon as practicable, ERCOT shall notify each QSE through the Messaging System of any of its Ancillary Service Trades that are invalid Ancillary Service Trades.  The QSE may correct and resubmit any invalid Ancillary Service Trade, but the reporting time of the trade is determined by when the validated Ancillary Service Trade was submitted and not when the original invalid Ancillary Service Trade was submitted. 
(4)	A QSE with an Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility for ECRS, originally designated to be provided by a Generation Resource, may transfer its responsibility via Ancillary Service Trade(s) to another QSE only if that QSE designates the ECRS will be provided by a Generation Resource.

4.4.7.3.1	Ancillary Service Trade Criteria
(1)	Each Ancillary Service Trade must be reported by a QSE and must include the following information: 
(a)	The buying QSE;
(b)	The selling QSE;
(c)	The type of Ancillary Service;
(d)	The quantity in MW; and
(e)	The first and last hours of the trade.
(f)	For RRS, the QSE shall indicate the quantity of the service that is provided from:
(i)	Resources providing Primary Frequency Response;
(ii)	FFR Resources; and
(iii)	Load Resources controlled by high-set under-frequency relays.
[NPRR1014:  Replace paragraph (f) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(f)	For RRS, the QSE shall indicate the quantity of the service that is provided from:
(i)	Resources capable of providing Primary Frequency Response;
(ii)	ESRs and Load Resources providing FFR; and
(iii)	Load Resources controlled by high-set under-frequency relays.
(2)	For ECRS, the QSE shall indicate the quantity of the service that is provided from Resources that are manually dispatched and those that are SCED-dispatchable.
[NPRR1213:  Replace paragraph (2) above with the following upon system implementation, and upon system implementation of NPRR1171, and renumber accordingly:]
(2)	For ECRS, the QSE shall indicate the quantity of the service that is provided from:
(a)	Manually dispatched Resources; 
(b)	SCED-dispatchable Resources that are not DGRs and DESRs on circuits subject to Load shed; and
(c)	DGRs and DESRs on circuits subject to Load shed.
(3)	For Non-Spin, the QSE shall indicate the quantity of the service that is provided from:
(a)	Load Resources that are not Controllable Load Resources; 
(b)	Generation Resources that are not DGRs or DESRs on circuits subject to Load shed and Controllable Load Resources; and
(c)	DGRs and DESRs on circuits subject to Load shed.
(3)	An Ancillary Service Trade must be confirmed by both the buying QSE and selling QSE to be considered valid and to be used in an ERCOT process.
4.4.7.3.2	Ancillary Service Trade Validation
(1)	A valid Ancillary Service Trade is an Ancillary Service Trade that ERCOT has determined meets the criteria listed in Section 4.4.7.3.1, Ancillary Service Trade Criteria.  Only one confirmed Ancillary Service Trade is allowed for the same buying and selling QSEs for each type of Ancillary Service for each hour.
(2)	When an Ancillary Service Trade is reported to ERCOT, ERCOT shall notify both the buying and selling QSEs by using the Messaging System if available and the MIS Certified Area.  
(3)	ERCOT shall continuously validate Ancillary Service Trades and continuously display on the MIS Certified Area information that allows any QSE named in an Ancillary Service Trade to view its confirmed and unconfirmed Ancillary Service Trades.  ERCOT shall also post to the MIS Certified Area any unconfirmed Ancillary Service Trades for QSEs on an hourly basis for all remaining hours of the current Operating Day and all hours of the next Operating Day. 
(4)	The QSE that first reports the Ancillary Service Trade to ERCOT is deemed to have confirmed the Ancillary Service Trade unless it subsequently affirmatively rejects it.  The QSE that first reports an Ancillary Service Trade may reject, edit, or delete an Ancillary Service Trade that its counterpart has not confirmed.  The counterpart is deemed to have confirmed the Ancillary Service Trade when it submits an identical Ancillary Service Trade.  After both the buyer and seller have confirmed an Ancillary Service Trade, either party may reject it at any time, but the rejection is effective only for any ERCOT process for which the deadline for reporting Ancillary Service Trades has not yet passed.  
4.4.7.4	Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility
(1)	A QSE’s Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility is the net amount of Ancillary Service capacity that the QSE is obligated to deliver to ERCOT, by hour and service type.  The Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility is the difference in MW, by hour and service type, between the amounts specified in items (a) and (b) defined as follows:
(a)	The sum of:
(i)	The QSE’s Self-Arranged Ancillary Service Quantity; plus
(ii)	The total (in MW) of Ancillary Service Trades for which the QSE is the seller; plus
(iii)	Awards to the QSE of Ancillary Service Offers in the DAM; plus
(iv)	Awards to the QSE of Ancillary Service Offers in the SASM; plus
(v)	RUC-committed Ancillary Service quantities to the QSE from its Resources committed by the RUC process to provide Ancillary Service; and 
(b)	The sum of:
(i)	The total Ancillary Service Trades for which the QSE is the buyer; plus
(ii)	The total Ancillary Service capacity identified as the QSE’s failure to provide as described in Section 6.4.9.1.3, Failure to Provide Ancillary Service; plus
(iii)	The total Ancillary Service capacity identified as the QSE’s infeasible Ancillary Service, as described in Section 6.4.9.1.2, Replacement of Infeasible Ancillary Service Due to Transmission Constraints; plus
(iv)	The total Ancillary Service capacity identified as the QSE’s reconfiguration amount as described in Section 6.4.9.2, Supplemental Ancillary Services Market.
(2)	A QSE may only use a RUC-committed Resource during that Resource’s RUC-Committed Interval to meet the QSE’s Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility if the Resource has been committed by the RUC process to provide Ancillary Service.  The QSE shall only provide from the RUC-committed Resource the exact amount and type of Ancillary Service for which it was committed by RUC.
(3)	By 1430 in the Day-Ahead, the QSE must notify ERCOT, in the QSE’s COP, which Resources represented by the QSE will provide the Ancillary Service capacity necessary to meet the QSE’s Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility, specified by Resource, hour, and service type.  The DAM Ancillary Service awards are Resource-specific; the QSE must include those DAM awards in its COP, and the QSE may not change that Resource-specific DAM award information until after 1600 under the conditions set out in Section 3.9, Current Operating Plan (COP). 
(4)	Section 6.4.9.1.3 specifies what happens if the QSE fails to provide its Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility.
(5)	A QSE’s Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility must be met by identified Resources that are qualified to provide the Ancillary Service, per Section 8.1.1.2.1, Ancillary Service Technical Requirements and Qualification Criteria and Test Methods, and available to act on Dispatch Instructions.
