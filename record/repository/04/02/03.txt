4.2.3	PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource Production Potential
(1)	ERCOT shall produce and update hourly a Short-Term PhotoVoltaic Power Forecast (STPPF) that provides a rolling 168-hour hourly forecast of PhotoVoltaic production potential for each PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource (PVGR).  ERCOT shall produce and post to the ERCOT website every five minutes an Intra-Hour PhotoVoltaic Power Forecast (IHPPF) by PhotoVoltaic region that provides a forecast of ERCOT-wide PhotoVoltaic production potential for each five-minute interval over the next two hours from each forecast model.  The posting shall indicate which forecast model was being used by ERCOT for GTBD calculation purposes.  ERCOT shall produce and update an hourly Total ERCOT PhotoVoltaic Power Forecast (TEPPF) providing a probability distribution of the hourly production potential from all PhotoVoltaic Generation Resources in ERCOT for each of the next 168 hours.  Each Generation Entity that owns a PVGR shall install and telemeter to ERCOT the site-specific meteorological information that ERCOT determines is necessary to produce the STPPF and TEPPF forecasts.  ERCOT shall establish procedures specifying the accuracy requirements of PVGR meteorological information telemetry. 
[NPRR1029:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(1)	ERCOT shall produce and update hourly a Short-Term PhotoVoltaic Power Forecast (STPPF) that provides a rolling 168-hour hourly forecast of PhotoVoltaic (PV) production potential for each PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource (PVGR) and for the PV component of each DC-Coupled Resource.  ERCOT shall produce and post to the ERCOT website every five minutes an Intra-Hour PhotoVoltaic Power Forecast (IHPPF) by PhotoVoltaic region that provides a forecast of ERCOT-wide PhotoVoltaic production potential for each five-minute interval over the next two hours from each forecast model.  The posting shall indicate which forecast model was being used by ERCOT for GTBD calculation purposes.  ERCOT shall produce and update an hourly Total ERCOT PhotoVoltaic Power Forecast (TEPPF) providing a probability distribution of the hourly production potential from all PhotoVoltaic Generation Resources and the PV components of all DC-Coupled Resources in ERCOT for each of the next 168 hours.  A Resource Entity with a PVGR or DC-Coupled Resource that has a PV component shall install equipment to enable telemetry of site-specific meteorological information that ERCOT determines is necessary to produce the STPPF and TEPPF forecasts, and the Resource Entity’s QSE shall telemeter such information and Resource status information to ERCOT.  ERCOT shall establish procedures specifying the accuracy requirements of meteorological information telemetry for PVGRs and DC-Coupled Resources with a PV component. 
(2)	ERCOT shall use the probabilistic TEPPF and select the forecast that the actual total ERCOT PVGR production is expected to exceed 50% of the time (50% probability of exceedance forecast).  To produce the STPPF, ERCOT will allocate the TEPPF 50% probability of exceedance forecast to each PVGR such that the sum of the individual STPPF forecasts equal the TEPPF forecast.  The updated STPPF forecasts for each hour for each PVGR are to be used as input into each RUC process as per Section 5, Transmission Security Analysis and Reliability Unit Commitment.

(3)	ERCOT shall produce the PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource Production Potential (PVGRPP) forecasts using the information provided by PVGR owners including PVGR availability, meteorological information, and SCADA.

(4)	Each hour, ERCOT shall provide, through the Messaging System, the STPPF and PVGRPP forecasts for each PVGR to the QSE that represents that PVGR and shall post each STPPF and PVGRPP forecast on the MIS Certified Area.

(5)	After the aggregated ERCOT PVGR capacity reaches one GW and the maximum PVGR capacity ratio of a single PVGR over the total ERCOT installed PVGR capacity is at or below 60%, each hour ERCOT shall post to the ERCOT website, on a system-wide basis the hourly actual PhotoVoltaic (PV) power production, STPPF, PVGRPP, and aggregate COP HSLs for On-Line PVGRs for a rolling historical 48-hour period.  The system-wide STPPF, PVGRPP, and aggregate COP HSLs for On-Line PVGRs will also be posted for the rolling future 168-hour period.  ERCOT shall retain the STPPF and PVGRPP for each hour. However, ERCOT shall post this information no later than June 1, 2016.

(6)	Each hour, ERCOT shall post to the ERCOT website the hourly system-wide and regional STPPF and PVGRPP values produced by each forecast model for On-Line PVGRs for the rolling historical 48-hour period and the rolling future 168-hour period.  ERCOT’s posting shall also indicate which forecast model it is using for each region to populate COPs.
