9.19.1	Default Uplift Invoices
(1)	ERCOT shall collect the total short-pay amount for all Settlement Invoices for a month, less the total payments expected from a payment plan, from Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs) and CRR Account Holders.  ERCOT must pay the funds it collects from payments on Default Uplift Invoices to the Entities previously short-paid.  ERCOT shall notify those Entities of the details of the payment.
(2)	Each Counter-Party’s share of the uplift is calculated using the best available Settlement data for each Operating Day in the month prior to the month in which the default occurred (the “reference month”), and is calculated as follows:
DURSCPcp = TSPA * MMARScp
Where:
