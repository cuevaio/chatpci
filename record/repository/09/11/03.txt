9.11.3	Partial Payments by Invoice Recipients for CRR Auction Revenue Distribution
(1)	If at least one Invoice Recipient owing funds does not pay its CARD Invoice in full (short-pay), ERCOT shall follow the procedure set forth below:
(a)	ERCOT shall make every reasonable attempt to collect payment from each short-paying Invoice Recipient before any payments owed by ERCOT for that month’s distribution of CRR Auction revenues is due to be paid to applicable Invoice Recipient(s). 
(b)	ERCOT shall draw on any available security pledged to ERCOT by each short-paying Invoice Recipient that did not pay the amount due under paragraph (a) above.  If the amount of any such draw is greater than the amount of the short-paying Invoice Recipient’s cash collateral held in excess of that required to cover its Total Potential Exposure (TPE) (“Excess Collateral”), then a draw on available security for a short-paying Invoice Recipient shall be considered a Late Payment for purposes of Section 16.11.6, Payment Breach and Late Payments by Market Participants.
(c)	ERCOT shall offset or recoup any amounts owed, or to be owed, by ERCOT to a short-paying Invoice Recipient against amounts not paid by that Invoice Recipient and ERCOT shall apply the amount offset or recouped to cover payment shortages by that Invoice Recipient.
(d)	If, after taking the actions set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), above, ERCOT still does not have sufficient funds to pay all amounts that it owes to CARD Invoice Recipients in full, ERCOT shall reduce payments to all CARD Invoice Recipients owed monies from ERCOT.  The reductions shall be based on a pro rata basis of monies owed to each CARD Invoice Recipient, to the extent necessary to clear ERCOT’s accounts on the payment due date to achieve revenue neutrality for ERCOT.  ERCOT shall provide to all Market Participants payment details on all short payments and subsequent reimbursements of short pays.  Details must include the identity of each short-paying Invoice Recipient and the dollar amount attributable to that Invoice Recipient, broken down by Invoice numbers.  In addition, ERCOT shall provide the aggregate total of all amounts due to all Invoice Recipients before applying the amount not paid on the CARD Invoice.
