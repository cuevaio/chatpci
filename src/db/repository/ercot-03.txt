ERCOT shall accept this change and, in the event that a Transmission Facilities Outage was scheduled concurrently with the affected Resource(s) Outage, ERCOT shall coordinate between the TSP and the Resource Entity to schedule a time mutually agreeable to both parties for the Resource to be On-Line.  If mutual agreement cannot be reached, then ERCOT shall decide, considering expected impact on ERCOT System security, future Outage plans, and participants.
3.1.6.5	Evaluation of Proposed Resource Outage
(1)	If a proposed Resource Outage, in conjunction with previously accepted Outages, would cause a violation of applicable reliability standards, ERCOT shall:
(a)	Communicate with the requesting QSE as required under Section 3.1.6.8, Resource Outage Rejection Notice;
(b)	Investigate possible Constraint Management Plans (CMPs) to resolve security violations, based upon security and reliability analysis results and strive to maximize transmission usage consistent with reliable operation; and
(c)	Consider modifying the previous acceptance or approval of one or more Transmission Facilities or reliability Resource Outages, considering order of receipt and impact to the ERCOT System.
(2)	If transmission security can be maintained using an alternative considered in items (1)(b) and (1)(c) above, then ERCOT may, in its judgment, direct the selected alternatives and approve the proposed Resource Outage.
(3)	If ERCOT does not resolve transmission security issues by using the alternatives considered in items (1)(b) and (1)(c) above, then ERCOT shall reject the proposed Resource Outage.
3.1.6.6	Timelines for Response by ERCOT for Resource Planned Outages
(1)	ERCOT shall approve or reject each request in accordance with the following table:

Furthermore, in its sole discretion, ERCOT may approve Planned Outage durations that exceed the maximum durations prescribed in the table above.
(3)	The maximum duration of Planned Outages does not apply for Resource Outages under a Notification of Suspension of Operations (NSO) pursuant to Section 3.14.1.1, Notification of Suspension of Operations.
3.1.6.7		Delay
(1)	ERCOT may delay its approval or rejection of a proposed Planned Outage plan if the requesting Resource Entity has not submitted sufficient or complete information within the time frames set forth in this Section 3.1.6, Outages of Resources Other than Reliability Resources.  Review periods for Planned Outage consideration do not commence until sufficient and complete information is submitted to ERCOT as described in Section 3.1.6.2, Resource Outage Plan.
3.1.6.8	Resource Outage Rejection Notice
(1)	If ERCOT rejects a request for a Planned Outage, ERCOT shall provide the QSE a written or electronic rejection notice that includes:
(a)	Specific reasons causing the rejection; or
(b)	Possible remedies or Resource schedule revisions, if any, that might mitigate the basis for rejection.
(2)	ERCOT may reject a Planned Outage of Resource facilities only:
(a)	To protect the reliability or security of the ERCOT System;
(b)	Due to insufficient information regarding the Outage;
(c)	Due to failure to comply with submittal process requirements, as specified in these Protocols;
(d)	To stay within the Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity; or
(e)	As specified elsewhere in these Protocols.
(3)	When multiple proposed Planned Outages or Maintenance Outages cause a known capacity conflict, ERCOT shall:
(a)	Communicate with each QSE to see if the QSE will adjust its proposed Planned Outage schedule;
(b)	Determine if each QSE will agree to an alternative Outage schedule; or
(c)	Reject, in ERCOT’s sole discretion, one or more proposed Outages, considering order of receipt and impact to the ERCOT System.
3.1.6.9	Withdrawal of Approval and Rescheduling of Approved Planned Outages of Resource Facilities
(1)	If ERCOT believes it cannot meet applicable reliability standards and has exercised all other reasonable options, and any actions taken pursuant to Section 3.1.4.6, Outage Coordination of Potential Transmission Emergency Conditions, have not resolved the situation, then ERCOT shall conduct a preliminary Outage Adjustment Evaluation (OAE) and issue an Advance Action Notice (AAN) pursuant to Section 6.5.9.3.1.1, Advance Action Notice.  
(a)	The AAN shall describe the reliability problem, the date and time that the possible Emergency Condition would begin, the date and time that the possible Emergency Condition would end, and a summary of the actions ERCOT believes it might take, including, if applicable, the amount of capacity it would seek from one or more OSAs based on the preliminary OAE.  The AAN must state the earliest time at which ERCOT will issue OSAs, if an OSA is deemed necessary.
(b)	ERCOT shall issue the AAN a minimum of 24 hours prior to issuing any OSA.  Additionally, unless impracticable pursuant to paragraph (3)(f) below, OSAs should not be issued until eight Business Hours have elapsed following issuance of the AAN.  ERCOT shall not issue an OSA under this Section unless it has first completed an updated OAE after these time periods have passed.
(c)	Following the AAN, ERCOT may communicate with Market Participants about the reliability problem, however, ERCOT may not provide information about market conditions to a subset of Market Participants that is not generally available to all Market Participants.  
(d)	As conditions change, ERCOT shall, to the extent practicable, update the AAN in order to provide simultaneous notice to Market Participants.  
(e)	This section does not limit Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) access to ERCOT data and communications. 
(2)	Before the time stated in the AAN when ERCOT will issue any OSAs, each QSE shall:
(a) 	Update its Resource COPs and the Outage Scheduler to the best of its ability to reflect any decisions to voluntarily delay or cancel any Outage so as to remove the Outage from updated OAE and OSA consideration;  
(b) 	Notify ERCOT if a specific Resource cannot be considered for an OSA, for all or part of the period covered by the AAN, due to Resource reliability, compliance with contractual warranty obligations, or other reasons beyond the Resource’s control; and
(c)	Notify ERCOT of any Resource that is currently on Outage that the QSE agrees could be returned to service, upon receipt of an OSA, for all or part of the period covered by the AAN.
(3)	If, after the earliest OSA issuance time has passed as noted in paragraph (1)(b) above, ERCOT continues to forecast an inability to meet applicable reliability standards after the updates to the Resource COPs and Outage Schedules, ERCOT may issue one or more OSAs.  
(a)	ERCOT may contact QSEs representing Resources for more information prior to conducting any updated OAE or issuing an OSA.
(b)	ERCOT may not consider nuclear-powered Generation Resources for an OSA.
(c)	ERCOT will not consider any Resource for an OSA if the Resource’s QSE notified ERCOT prior to the earliest issuance time of any OSA stated in the AAN that the Resource cannot be considered for an OSA for the reasons specified in paragraph (2)(b) above.
(d)	In order to determine which Outages to delay, ERCOT shall first consider the Outage duration, dividing the Outages in categories of zero to two days, two to four days, four to seven days, or more than seven days, then withdraw approval on a last in, first out basis within that duration category, so that shorter Outages are delayed first, and the timing of Outage submissions is considered within that category.
(e)	After the earliest issuance time of the OSAs stated in the AAN, if the updated OAE shows that one or more OSAs is still necessary, ERCOT shall post a message to the ERCOT website stating that it will issue one or more OSAs and shall provide verbal notice to TSPs and QSEs via the Hotline.  Subsequent to this notification, and for the entire period identified in the AAN, the QSE may not voluntarily modify the Resource’s Outage, but is subject to the issuance of an OSA.
(f)	ERCOT may only issue an OSA to the QSE for a Resource that has a Resource Outage in the Outage Scheduler during the timeframe of the forecasted Emergency Condition described above in this section.
(g)	If the Resource Outage for which the OSA would be issued is scheduled to begin before eight Business Hours have elapsed following issuance of the AAN, ERCOT may issue the OSA prior to the beginning of the Resource Outage after the end of the 24-hour notice period.
(h)	Following the receipt of an OSA, for the OSA Period: 
(i)	The QSE for the Resource may choose to show the Resource as OFF in the COP or may elect to leave the Resource On-Line due to equipment or reliability concerns or if the Resource Category is coal or lignite.  If the QSE for the Resource intends to leave the Resource On-Line, it must communicate to the ERCOT control room the anticipated start and end time of the On-Line period.  ERCOT will issue one or multiple RUC instructions to the QSE of the Resource for the anticipated On-Line period within the OSA Period for each Operating Day.  While On-Line, the Resource must utilize a status of ONRUC and cannot opt out of RUC Settlement;
(ii)	If the Resource remains On-Line pursuant to paragraph (i) above, it must remain at Low Sustained Limit (LSL) unless deployed above LSL by Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED);
(iii)	If the Resource has a COP Resource Status of OFF at any point during the OSA Period, and ERCOT requires the Resource to be On-Line, or if ERCOT requires a Resource with a planned derate to maintain its capacity, ERCOT will issue a RUC instruction to the Resource’s QSE for the required commitment period.  While On-Line, the Resource must utilize a status of ONRUC and cannot opt out of RUC Settlement; 
(iv)	The QSE must update the Resource’s Energy Offer Curve to $4,500/MWh for all MW levels from 0 MW to the HSL when the High System-Wide Offer Cap (HCAP) is in effect.  If the Low-System Wide Offer Cap (LCAP) is in effect, the QSE must update the Resource’s Energy Offer Curve equal to LCAP for all MW levels from 0 MW to HSL; and
[NPRR930:  Replace paragraph (iv) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(iv)	ERCOT shall create proxy Energy Offer Curves for the Resource under paragraph (4)(d)(iii) of Section 6.5.7.3, Security Constrained Economic Dispatch; and
(v)	The QSE for the Resource cannot submit a Three Part Supply Offer into the Day-Ahead Market (DAM) for any Operating Day during the OSA Period.
(4)	ERCOT shall work in good faith with the QSEs to reschedule any delayed or canceled Outages resulting from an AAN under paragraph (1) above, regardless of whether the Resource took voluntary actions or received an OSA.  The Outage must be rescheduled so that it is completed within 120 days of the end of the OSA Period.  ERCOT, in its sole discretion, may approve any Outage that is rescheduled due to an AAN or OSA even if it would cause the aggregate MW of approved Resource Outages to exceed the Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity.
(a)	If ERCOT issues an OSA, the QSE may submit a new request for approval of the Planned Outage schedule, however the new Outage may not begin prior to the end time of the OSA Period.  
(b)	If a transmission Outage was scheduled in coordination with a Resource Outage that is delayed, ERCOT shall also delay that transmission Outage when necessary.
(5)	If insufficient capacity to meet the need described in the AAN is made available through the processes described in paragraphs (2) and (3) above, ERCOT may contact QSEs with Resources that are currently on Outage in the Outage Scheduler and that the QSE has agreed could be returned to service upon receipt of an OSA.  ERCOT may issue an OSA to the QSE for any Resource that the QSE agrees can feasibly be returned to service during the period of the possible Emergency Condition described in the AAN.
(6)	If system conditions change such that the need described in the AAN increases, ERCOT shall update the AAN and may repeat the process described in this section.  For any subsequent iterations of this process, ERCOT shall issue the updated AAN with as much lead time as is practical prior to starting any subsequent OAE, but with a minimum of two hours’ notice. 
(7)	The preliminary OAE may not assume total renewable production lower than the sum of the selected Wind-powered Generation Resource Production Potential (WGRPP) and PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource Production Potential (PVGRPP) forecasts for each hour less any reasonably expected severe weather impacts.  The available capacity in ERCOT’s planning assessment must include targeted reserve levels and include forecasted capacity available through DC Tie imports or curtailment of DC Tie exports, forecasted capacity provided from Settlement Only Distributed Generators (SODGs) and Settlement Only Transmission Generators (SOTGs), and forecasted capacity from price-responsive Demand based on information reported to ERCOT in accordance with Section 3.10.7.2.1, Reporting of Demand Response.  ERCOT must post the following inputs to the preliminary OAE to the ERCOT website within an hour of issuing an AAN, including but not limited to:
(a)	The Load forecast; 
(b)	Load forecast vendor selection;
(c)	Wind forecast;

(m)	Any aggregate derating of Resource(s) and/or Forced Outage assumptions in total MWs; and
(n)	Any aggregate fuel derating assumptions in total MWs.
[NPRR995:  Replace paragraph (7) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(7)	The preliminary OAE may not assume total renewable production lower than the sum of the selected Wind-powered Generation Resource Production Potential (WGRPP) and PhotoVoltaic Generation Resource Production Potential (PVGRPP) forecasts for each hour less any reasonably expected severe weather impacts.  The available capacity in ERCOT’s preliminary OAE must include targeted reserve levels and include forecasted capacity available through DC Tie imports or curtailment of DC Tie exports, forecasted capacity provided from Settlement Only Distributed Generators (SODGs), Settlement Only Transmission Generators (SOTGs), Settlement Only Distribution Energy Storage Systems (SODESSs), and Settlement Only Transmission Energy Storage Systems (SOTESSs), and forecasted capacity from price-responsive Demand based on information reported to ERCOT in accordance with Section 3.10.7.2.1, Reporting of Demand Response.

(8)	Notwithstanding anything in this Section, ERCOT need not comply with any other requirement in this Section if the occurrence of an unforeseen Real-Time condition requires that ERCOT withdraw approval of one or more Resource Outages in order to meet applicable reliability standards.  The unforeseen Real-Time condition cannot be the result of changes that Ancillary Services are procured to address.  In exercising its discretion under this paragraph, ERCOT is not required to issue an AAN or OAE before issuing an OSA, but shall:
(a)	Issue the OSA to the QSE of the Resource for the purpose of make whole compensation; and
(b)	Present the justification for the out of market action to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) at its next meeting that is at least 14 Business Days after the OSA.
3.1.6.10	Opportunity Outage
(1)	Opportunity Outages for Resources are a special category of Planned Outages that may be approved by ERCOT when a specific Resource has been forced Off-Line due to a Forced Outage and the Resource has been previously approved for a Planned Outage during the next two days.
(2)	When a Forced Outage occurs on a Resource that has an approved Outage scheduled within the following two days, the Resource may remain Off-Line and start the approved Outage earlier than scheduled.  The QSE must give as much notice as practicable to ERCOT.
(3)	Opportunity Outages of Transmission Facilities may be approved by ERCOT when a specific Resource is Off-Line due to a Forced, Planned or Maintenance Outage.  A TSP may request an Opportunity Outage at any time.  
(4)	When an Outage occurs on a Resource that has an approved Transmission Facilities Opportunity Outage request on file, the TSP may start the approved Outage as soon as practical after receiving authorization to proceed by ERCOT.  ERCOT must give as much notice as practicable to the TSP.
3.1.6.11	Outage Returning Early
(1)	A Resource that completes a Planned Outage early and wants to resume operation shall notify ERCOT of the early return prior to resuming service by making appropriate entries in the COP or Outage Scheduler if applicable as much in advance as practicable, but not later than at least two hours prior to beginning startup.  Within two hours of receiving such request, ERCOT shall either:
(a) 	Approve the request unless, as a result of complying with the request, ERCOT cannot maintain system reliability or security with the Resource injection.  In such a case, ERCOT shall issue a Verbal Dispatch Instruction (VDI) to the Resource’s QSE to stay Off-Line; or 
(b) 	Coordinate between the TSP and Resource Entity to schedule a time agreeable to both parties for the Resource to be Off-Line in the event if that a Transmission Facilities Outage requires the affected Resource to be Off-Line. If mutual agreement is not reached, then ERCOT shall decide on the appropriate time, after considering expected impacts on system security, future Outage plans, and participants and issue a VDI to the Resource’s QSE to stay Off-Line. 
(2)	Before an early return from an Outage, a Resource Entity or QSE may inquire of ERCOT whether the Resource is expected to be decommitted by ERCOT upon its early return.  If a Resource Entity or QSE is notified by ERCOT that the Resource will be decommitted if it returns early and the Resource Entity or QSE starts the Resource within the previously accepted or approved Outage period, then the QSE representing the Resource will not be paid any decommitment compensation as otherwise would be provided for in Section 5.7, Settlement for RUC Process. 
3.1.6.12	Resource Coming On-Line
(1)	Before start-up and synchronizing On-Line, a Resource Entity or QSE may inquire of ERCOT whether the Resource is expected to be decommitted by ERCOT upon its coming On-Line.  If a Resource Entity or QSE is notified by ERCOT that the Resource will be decommitted if the Resource comes On-Line and the Resource Entity or QSE starts the Resource, then the QSE representing the Resource will not be paid any decommitment compensation as otherwise would be provided for in Section 5.7.3, Payment When ERCOT Decommits a QSE-Committed Resource.
3.1.6.13	Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity
(1)	ERCOT shall calculate a maximum capacity of Resource Planned Outages, excluding Outages of nuclear-powered generation facilities and Outages of QFs that are subject to the exemption in paragraph (7) of Section 3.1.6, Outages of Resources Other than Reliability Resources, that should be allowed on each day of the next 60 months.
(a)	For days more than seven days ahead of the Operating Day, the calculation of this Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity will be based on seasonal assumptions, planned Resources that have met the criteria in Planning Guide Section 6.9, Addition of Proposed Generation to the Planning Models, Planned Outages of nuclear Generation Resources, Planned Outages of QFs that are subject to the exemption in paragraph (7) of Section 3.1.6, and the long-term Load forecast.  ERCOT shall update the calculation of the Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity for the next 60 months twice per month.
(b)	For days that are seven days or less prior to the Operating Day, the calculation of this Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity will be based on the inputs used for the planning assessment for an OAE described in Section 3.1.6.9, Withdrawal of Approval and Rescheduling of Approved Planned Outages of Resource Facilities.  ERCOT shall update the calculation of the Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity for each hour of the next seven days on a rolling daily basis.
(c)	ERCOT shall post the Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity and aggregate MW of approved Resource Planned Outages at least twice per day on the ERCOT website for each day of the next 60 months.
(d)	ERCOT shall post the Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity and aggregate MW of approved Resource Planned Outages hourly on the ERCOT website for each hour of the next seven days.
(2)	ERCOT may adjust the Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity if, at any point in time, the actual aggregate Forced Outages and Maintenance Outages exceed the amount that is used in the assessment of the Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity.
(3)	ERCOT shall post on the ERCOT website the methodology it uses to calculate the Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity in accordance with the parameters established by paragraphs (1) and (2) above.  The methodology and any revisions thereto shall be approved by the ERCOT Board of Directors.  ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice describing any revision and the justification for such revision and shall provide at least 14 days for stakeholder comment on the proposed revision unless ERCOT determines that, due to an actual or anticipated Emergency Condition, a shorter comment period is warranted.  Upon adopting a change to the methodology, ERCOT shall post the revised methodology on the ERCOT website and issue a Market Notice announcing the posting.
3.1.6.14	Distribution Facility Outages Impacting Distribution Generation Resources and Distribution Energy Storage Resources
(1)       	A Distribution Service Provider (DSP) must notify the party designated by the Distribution Generation Resource (DGR) or Distribution Energy Storage Resource (DESR) (Resource Entity or QSE) if the DSP plans to take an outage on any distribution facility that will impact the operation of a DGR or DESR.  The Resource Entity for the DGR or DESR shall submit a Planned or Maintenance Resource Outage, as appropriate, to reflect the unavailability of the Resource due to the DSP outage.  ERCOT may not reject a DGR or DESR Outage taken due to a DSP system outage, nor may ERCOT require the DSP to reschedule the outage.  However, ERCOT may consult with the DSP about rescheduling the outage.
3.1.7	Reliability Resource Outages
(1)	ERCOT shall evaluate requests for approval of an Outage of a Reliability Resource to determine if any one or a combination of proposed Outages may cause ERCOT to violate applicable reliability standards or exceed the Maximum Daily Resource Planned Outage Capacity.  ERCOT’s evaluations shall take into consideration factors including the following: 
(a)	Load forecast;
(b)	All other known Outages; and
(c)	Potential for the proposed Outages to cause irresolvable transmission overloads or voltage supply concerns based on the indications from contingency analysis software.
3.1.7.1	Timelines for Response by ERCOT on Reliability Resource Outages

3.2 	Analysis of Resource Adequacy
3.2.1	Calculation of Aggregate Resource Capacity
(1)	ERCOT shall use Outages in the Outage Scheduler and, when applicable, the Resource Status from the Current Operating Plan (COP) to calculate the aggregate capacity from Generation Resources and Load Resources projected to be available in the ERCOT Region and in Forecast Zones in ERCOT.  “Forecast Zones” have the same boundaries as the 2003 ERCOT Congestion Management Zones (CMZs).  Each Resource will be mapped to a Forecast Zone during the registration process.
[NPRR1014 and NPRR1029:  Replace applicable portions of paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(1)	ERCOT shall use Outages in the Outage Scheduler and, when applicable, the Resource Status from the Current Operating Plan (COP) to calculate the aggregate capacity from Generation Resources, Energy Storage Resources (ESRs), and Load Resources projected to be available in the ERCOT Region and in Forecast Zones in ERCOT.  “Forecast Zones” have the same boundaries as the 2003 ERCOT Congestion Management Zones (CMZs).  Each Resource will be mapped to a Forecast Zone during the registration process.
(2)	On a rolling hourly basis, ERCOT shall calculate the aggregate hourly Generation Resource capacity and Load Resource capacity in the ERCOT Region and Forecast Zones projected to be available during each hour for the following seven days.
[NPRR1014 and NPRR1029:  Replace applicable portions of paragraph (2) above with the following upon system implementation:]

[NPRR1029:  Replace paragraph (3) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(3)	Projections of generation capacity from Intermittent Renewable Resources (IRRs) and the intermittent renewable generation components of DC-Coupled Resources shall be consistent with capacity availability estimates, such as the effective Load carrying capability of wind, developed jointly between ERCOT and the appropriate Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) subcommittee and approved by the ERCOT Board or typical production expectations consistent with expected wind profiles as appropriate for the scenario being studied.
(4)	ERCOT shall publish procedures describing the IRR forecasting process on the ERCOT website.  
3.2.2	Demand Forecasts
(1)	Monthly, ERCOT shall develop the weekly peak hour Demand forecast for the ERCOT Region and for the Forecast Zones based on the 36-Month Load Forecast as described in Section 3.12, Load Forecasting, for the following 36 months, starting with the second week.  During the development of this forecast, ERCOT may consult with Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs), Transmission Service Providers (TSPs), and other Market Participants that may have knowledge of potential Load growth.
(2)	ERCOT may, at its discretion, publish on the MIS Secure Area, additional peak Demand analyses for periods beyond 36 months.
(3)	ERCOT shall develop and publish hourly on the ERCOT website, peak Demand forecasts by Forecast Zone for each hour of the next seven days using the Seven-Day Load Forecast as described in Section 3.12.

(ii)	Each intermediate stage; and
(iii)	Proposed final configuration.
3.3.2.2	Record of Approved Work
(1)	ERCOT shall maintain a record of all work approved in accordance with Section 3.3, Management of Changes to ERCOT Transmission Grid, and shall publish, and update monthly, information on the MIS Secure Area regarding each new Transmission Element to be installed on the ERCOT Transmission Grid. 
3.4	Load Zones 
(1)	ERCOT shall assign every power flow bus to a Load Zone for Day-Ahead Market (DAM) and Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Settlement purposes.  ERCOT shall calculate a Settlement Point Price for each Load Zone using the Load-weighted aggregated Shift Factors of the applicable energized power flow buses for each constraint.  The Load-weighting must be determined using the Load distribution factors.
(2)	ERCOT shall assign every Electrical Bus to a Load Zone for Real-Time Market (RTM) Settlement purposes.  ERCOT shall calculate a Settlement Point Price for each Load Zone as the Load-weighted average of the Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) at all Electrical Buses assigned to that Load Zone.  The Load-weighting must be determined using the Load, if any, from the State Estimator at each Electrical Bus.
3.4.1	Load Zone Types 
(1)	The Load Zone types are:
(a)	The Competitive Load Zones;  
(b)	The Non-Opt-In Entity (NOIE) Load Zones created pursuant to Section 3.4.3, NOIE Load Zones; and 
(c)	The Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) Load Zones as defined in Section 3.4.4, DC Tie Load Zones. 
(2)	The Competitive Load Zones are the four zones in effect during the 2003 ERCOT market unless they are changed pursuant to Section 3.4.2, Load Zone Modifications, less any Electrical Buses that are assigned to a NOIE Load Zone or a DC Tie Load Zone.
3.4.2	Load Zone Modifications
(1)	Competitive Load Zones and NOIE Load Zones may be added, deleted, or changed, only when approved by the ERCOT Board, with the exception of paragraph (1)(c) of Section 3.4.3, NOIE Load Zones.  Approved additions, deletions, or changes go into effect 48 months after the end of the month in which the addition, deletion, or change was approved, with the exception of paragraph (3) below.  DC Tie Load Zones are not subject to these requirements.
(2)       The addition of Load that is new to the ERCOT System to an existing Load Zone does not constitute a change to a Load Zone under this section.  This provision includes the transfer of existing Load from a non-ERCOT Control Area into a Load Zone in the ERCOT System.  Adding Load that is new to the ERCOT System to an existing Load Zone does not require ERCOT Board approval, and no notice period is required prior to adding such Load to an existing Load Zone.
(3)	A NOIE that was included in the establishment of an automatic pre-assigned NOIE Load Zone under paragraph (1)(c) of Section 3.4.3 may elect to be assigned to an appropriate Competitive Load Zone after giving notice of termination of its power supply arrangement if a request to be assigned to a Competitive Load Zone was given to ERCOT at least 90 days prior to the start of the Pre-Assigned Congestion Revenue Right (PCRR) nomination window for the effective year of the Load Zone change.  The move to a Competitive Load Zone requires ERCOT Board approval and shall be effective no sooner than the first day of the PCRR Nomination Year.  
3.4.3	NOIE Load Zones
(1)	The descriptions and conditions set forth below apply to Load Zones established by NOIEs:
(a)	There are four NOIE Load Zones that were approved prior to the Texas Nodal Market Implementation Date: Austin Energy, City Public Service, Rayburn Country Electric Cooperative, and Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA); 
(b)	Any costs allocated based upon a zonal Load Ratio Share (LRS) must be allocated using “Cost-Allocation Load Zones,” which are the four Load Zones in effect during the 2003 ERCOT market unless they are changed pursuant to Section 3.4.2, Load Zone Modifications.  For these allocation purposes, any NOIE Load Zone is considered to be located entirely within the 2003 ERCOT Congestion Management Zone (CMZ) that represented the largest Load for that NOIE or group of NOIEs in 2003;
(c)	A separate NOIE Load Zone is made up of a group of NOIEs that are parties to the same pre-1999 power supply arrangements and that had an overall 2003 peak Load in excess of 2,300 MW.  A NOIE that is a member of this separate NOIE Load Zone and that has given notice of termination of its pre-1999 power supply arrangement may elect to be assigned to an appropriate Competitive Load Zone.  Such an election shall be subject to the approval process in Section 3.4.2;
(d)	NOIEs may participate in only one NOIE Load Zone, and all Loads served by that NOIE must be contained within that Load Zone;
(e)	Except as specified otherwise in this subsection, Load Zones established by NOIEs will be treated the same as other Load Zones, including a 48-month notice requirement for ERCOT Board approval of any changes to Load Zones.  However, the addition of Load that is new to the ERCOT System, including the transfer of existing Load from a non-ERCOT Control Area, into an existing NOIE Load Zone is not a change to a Load Zone under these Protocols; and
(f)	Four years after a NOIE offers its Customers retail choice, the NOIE’s Load must be merged into the appropriate Competitive Load Zone(s).  For a Load Zone that is an aggregation of NOIE systems of which less than all of the NOIEs opt into Customer Choice, each remaining NOIE in that NOIE Load Zone may choose to have its Load merged into the appropriate Competitive Load Zone(s) under the same four-year time frame.
3.4.4	DC Tie Load Zones
(1)	A DC Tie Load Zone contains only the Electrical Bus in the ERCOT Transmission Grid that connects the DC Tie and is used in the settlement of the DC Tie Load in that zone.  
3.4.5	Additional Load Buses
(1)	ERCOT shall assign new Electrical Buses to a Load Zone and Cost Allocation Zone in accordance with the following rules; changes are effective immediately:
(a)	For each new Electrical Bus serving Load of a NOIE that is a part of a NOIE Load Zone, the new Electrical Bus will be assigned to that NOIE Load Zone;
(b)	For each new Electrical Bus not covered in paragraph (a) above, connected via Transmission Facilities to Electrical Buses all located within the same Competitive Load Zone, the new Electrical Bus will be assigned to that Competitive Load Zone; 
(c)	For each new Electrical Bus not covered in paragraphs (a) or (b) above, ERCOT shall simulate LMPs for the annual peak hour of the system with the new Electrical Bus incorporated into the model.  ERCOT shall assign that new Electrical Bus to the Competitive Load Zone with the closest matching zonal Settlement Point Price to the new Electrical Bus's LMP; 
(d)	For each new Electrical Bus covered in paragraph (a) above and connected via Transmission Facilities to Electrical Buses all located within the same Cost Allocation Zone, then the new Electrical Bus will be assigned to that Cost Allocation Zone;
(e)	For each new Electrical Bus covered in paragraph (a) above and not covered in paragraph (d) above, ERCOT shall simulate LMPs for the annual peak hour of the system with the new Electrical Bus incorporated into the model.  ERCOT shall assign each new Electrical Bus associated with a NOIE that is a part of a NOIE Load Zone to the Cost Allocation Zone with the closest matching zonal Settlement Point Price to the new Electrical Bus's LMP.
(f)	For each new Electrical Bus not covered in paragraph (a), the new Electrical Bus is assigned to the same Cost Allocation Zone as its designated Load Zone;   
3.5	Hubs
3.5.1	Process for Defining Hubs
(1)	Hubs settled through ERCOT may only be created by an amendment to Section 3.5.2, Hub Definitions.  Hubs are made up of one or more Electrical Buses.  ERCOT shall post the list of Electrical Buses (including their names) that are part of a Hub on the ERCOT website.  A Hub, once defined, may not be modified except as explicitly described in the definition of that Hub. 
(2)	When any Electrical Bus within a Hub Bus is added to the Network Operations Model or the Congestion Revenue Right (CRR) Network Model through changes to the Network Operations Model or CRR Network Model, ERCOT shall provide notice to all Market Participants as soon as practicable and include that Electrical Bus in the Hub Bus price calculation.
(3)	When any Electrical Bus within a Hub Bus is disconnected from the Network Operations Model or the CRR Network Model through operations changes in transmission topology temporarily, ERCOT shall provide notice to all Market Participants as soon as practicable and exclude that Electrical Bus from the Hub Bus price calculation.
(4)	In the event of a permanent change that removes the Hub Bus from the ERCOT Transmission Grid, ERCOT shall file a Nodal Protocol Revision Request (NPRR) to revise the appropriate Hub definition.  
(5)	If a Transmission Service Provider (TSP) or ERCOT plans a nomenclature change in the Network Operations Model or the CRR Network Model, ERCOT shall file a NPRR to include the nomenclature change in the Hub Bus definitions before implementing the name change to either the Network Operations Model or the CRR Network Model.
[NPRR857:  Replace paragraph (5) above with the following upon system implementation and satisfying the following conditions: (1) Southern Cross provides ERCOT with funds to cover the entire estimated cost of the project; and (2) Southern Cross has signed an interconnection agreement with a TSP and the TSP gives ERCOT written notice that Southern Cross has provided it with:  (a) Notice to proceed with the construction of the interconnection; and (b) The financial security required to fund the interconnection facilities:]
(5)	If a Transmission Service Provider (TSP), Direct Current Tie Operator (DCTO), or ERCOT plans a nomenclature change in the Network Operations Model or the CRR Network Model, ERCOT shall file a NPRR to include the nomenclature change in the Hub Bus definitions before implementing the name change to either the Network Operations Model or the CRR Network Model.

(3)	The Day-Ahead Settlement Point Price of the Hub for a given Operating Hour is calculated as follows: 
DASPP ERCOT345Bus =	DASL – █(Σ@c)(DAHUBSF ERCOT345Bus, c * DASP c), 
		if HBBC ERCOT345Bus≠0
DASPP ERCOT345Bus =	0, if HBBC ERCOT345Bus=0

In addition, each Resource Entity that owns a Resource, except for a Load Resource that is not SCED qualified, shall notify ERCOT of any known changes in that declaration no later than 14 days prior to the date that the change takes effect, or as soon as possible in a situation where the Resource Entity is unable to meet the 14-day Notice requirement.  However, in no event may the Resource Entity inform ERCOT later than 72 hours before the date on which the change in DME takes effect.  Upon ERCOT’s request, each Resource Entity that owns a Resource, except for a Load Resource that is not SCED qualified, shall provide ERCOT with sufficient information or documentation to verify the DME’s control of the Resource.  ERCOT shall update the DME for a Resource effective the first Operating Hour of the Operating Day after ERCOT satisfactorily confirms the Resource Entity’s most recent declaration, but not sooner than the effective date specified on the Resource Entity’s most recent declaration.

If a Resource Parameter is determined to be invalid, then ERCOT shall reject it and provide written notice to the QSE representing the Resource of the reason for the rejection.
3.8	Special Considerations
3.8.1	Split Generation Resources
(1)	When a generation meter is split, as provided for in Section 10.3.2.1, Generation Resource Meter Splitting, two or more independent Generation Resources must be created in the ERCOT Network Operations Model according to Section 3.10.7.2, Modeling of Resources and Transmission Loads, to function in all respects as Split Generation Resources in ERCOT System operation.  A Combined Cycle Train may not be registered in ERCOT as a Split Generation Resource.  A Distribution Generation Resource (DGR) or Distribution Energy Storage Resource (DESR) may not be registered in ERCOT as a Split Generation Resource.  An Energy Storage Resource (ESR) may not be registered in ERCOT as a Split Generation Resource.
(2)	Each Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) representing a Split Generation Resource shall collect and shall submit to ERCOT the Resource Parameters defined under Section 3.7, Resource Parameters, for the Split Generation Resource it represents.  The parameters provided must be consistent with the parameters submitted by each other QSE that represents a Split Generation Resource from the same Generation Resource.  The parameters submitted for each Split Generation Resource for limits and ramp rates must be according to the capability of the Split Generation Resource represented by the QSE.  Startup and shutdown times, time to change status and number of starts must be identical for all the Split Generation Resources from the same Generation Resource submitted by each QSE.  ERCOT shall review data submitted by each QSE representing Split Generation Resources for consistency and notify each QSE of any errors.
(3)	Each Split Generation Resource may be represented by a different QSE.  The Resource Entities that own or control the Split Generation Resources from a single Generation Resource must designate a Master QSE.  Each QSE representing a Split Generation Resource must comply in all respects to the requirements of a Generation Resource specified under these Protocols. 
(4)	The Master QSE shall: 
(a)	Serve as the Single Point of Contact for the Generation Resource, as required by Section 3.1.4.1, Single Point of Contact; 
(b)	Provide real-time telemetry for the total Generation Resource, as specified in Section 6.5.5.2, Operational Data Requirements; and 
(c)	Receive Verbal Dispatch Instructions (VDIs) from ERCOT, as specified in Section 6.5.7.8, Dispatch Procedures.  
(5)	Each QSE is responsible for representing its Split Generation Resource in its Current Operating Plan (COP).  During the Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) Study Periods, any conflict in the Resource Status of a Split Generation Resource in the COP is resolved according to the following:
(a)	If a Split Generation Resource has a Resource Status of OUT for any hour in the COP, then any other QSEs’ COP entries for their Split Generation Resources from the same Generation Resource are also considered unavailable for the hour; 
(b)	If the QSEs for all Split Generation Resources from the same Generation Resource have submitted a COP and at least one of the QSEs has an On-Line Resource Status in a given hour, then the status for all Split Generation Resources for the Generation Resource is considered to be On-Line for that hour, except if any of the QSEs has indicated in the COP a Resource Status of OUT.
(6)	Each QSE representing a Split Generation Resource shall update its individual Resource Status appropriately.
(7)	Each QSE representing a Split Generation Resource may independently submit Energy Offer Curves and Three-Part Supply Offers.  ERCOT shall treat each Split Generation Resource offer as a separate offer, except that all Split Generation Resources in a single Generation Resource must be committed or decommitted together. 
[NPRR1007:  Replace paragraph (7) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]
(7)	Each QSE representing a Split Generation Resource may independently submit Energy Offer Curves, Ancillary Service Offers, and Three-Part Supply Offers.  ERCOT shall treat each Split Generation Resource offer as a separate offer, except that all Split Generation Resources in a single Generation Resource must be committed or decommitted together.
(8)	Each QSE submitting verifiable cost data to ERCOT shall coordinate among all owners of a single Generation Resource to provide individual Split Generation Resource data consistent with the total verifiable cost of the entire Generation Resource.  ERCOT may compare the total verifiable costs with other similarly situated Generation Resources to determine the reasonability of the cost.
3.8.2	Combined Cycle Generation Resources
(1)	ERCOT shall assign a logical Resource Node for use in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM), RUC, Supplemental Ancillary Services Market (SASM), Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) and Load Frequency Control (LFC) to each registered Combined Cycle Train.  Each Combined Cycle Generation Resource registered in the Combined Cycle Train will be mapped to the Combined Cycle Train logical Resource Node for the purposes of evaluating and settling each Combined Cycle Generation Resource’s Three-Part Supply Offer and Ancillary Service Offer in the DAM, RUC and SCED.  Each generation unit identified in the Combined Cycle Train registration for a Combined Cycle Generation Resource configuration will be mapped to its designated Resource Node as determined in accordance with these Protocols and the Other Binding Document titled “Procedure for Identifying Resource Nodes.”
[NPRR1007:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project:]
(1)	ERCOT shall assign a logical Resource Node for use in the Day-Ahead Market (DAM), RUC, Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) and Load Frequency Control (LFC) to each registered Combined Cycle Train.  Each Combined Cycle Generation Resource registered in the Combined Cycle Train will be mapped to the Combined Cycle Train logical Resource Node for the purposes of evaluating and settling each Combined Cycle Generation Resource’s Three-Part Supply Offer and Ancillary Service Offer in the DAM, RUC and SCED.  Each generation unit identified in the Combined Cycle Train registration for a Combined Cycle Generation Resource configuration will be mapped to its designated Resource Node as determined in accordance with these Protocols and the Other Binding Document titled “Procedure for Identifying Resource Nodes.”
(2)	If any of the generation units, designated in the Combined Cycle Train registration as a primary generation unit in a Combined Cycle Generation Resource, is isolated from the ERCOT Transmission Grid because of a transmission Outage reported in the Outage Scheduler, the DAM and RUC applications shall select an alternate generation unit for use in the application.
(3)	Three-Part Supply Offers submitted for a Combined Cycle Generation Resource will be modeled as High Reasonability Limit (HRL)-weighted injections at the Resource Connectivity Nodes of the associated Generation Resources.  ERCOT shall use the logical Resource Node to settle these offers. 
(4)	In the DAM and RUC, ERCOT shall model the energy injection from each generation unit registered to the Combine Cycle Generation Resource designated in a Three-Part Supply Offer as follows:

Furthermore, until the QSE corrects its COP, the Off-Line Combined Cycle Generation Resources as designated through the application of this process are ineligible for RUC commitment or de-commitment Dispatch Instructions.
(b)	For any hour in which QSE-submitted COP entries are used to determine the initial state of a Combined Cycle Generation Resource for a DAM or Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC) study and the COP shows multiple Combined Cycle Generation Resources in a Combined Cycle Train to be in an On-Line Resource Status, then until the QSE corrects its COP, the On-Line Combined Cycle Generation Resource that has been On-Line for the longest time from the last recorded start by ERCOT systems, regardless of the reason for the start, combined with the COP Resource Status for the remaining hours of the current Operating Day, is considered to be On-Line at the start of the DRUC study period and all other COP-designated Combined Cycle Generation Resources in the Combined Cycle Train are considered to be Off-Line.

A QSE representing a DC-Coupled Resource shall provide the capacity value of the Energy Storage System (ESS) that is included in the HSL of the DC-Coupled Resource, and ERCOT will update the DC-Coupled Resource’s HSL with the sum of the forecasts of the intermittent renewable generation component and the QSE-submitted value for the ESS component.  ERCOT will notify the QSE via an Extensible Markup Language (XML) message each time COP HSL values are updated with the forecast values.  A QSE representing a WGR may override the STWPF HSL value but must submit an HSL value that is less than or equal to the amount for that Resource from the most recent STWPF provided by ERCOT; a QSE representing a PVGR may override the STPPF HSL value but must submit an HSL value that is less than or equal to the amount for that Resource from the most recent STPPF provided by ERCOT.

(9)	A QSE representing a Generation Resource that is not actively providing Ancillary Services or is providing Off-Line Non-Spin that the Resource will provide following the shutdown, may only use a Resource Status of SHUTDOWN to indicate to ERCOT through telemetry that the Resource is operating in a shutdown sequence or a Resource Status of ONTEST to indicate in the COP and through telemetry that the Generation Resource is performing a test of its operations either manually dispatched by the QSE or by ERCOT as part of the test.  A QSE representing a Generation Resource that is not actively providing Ancillary Services may only use a Resource Status of STARTUP to indicate to ERCOT through telemetry that the Resource is operating in a start-up sequence requiring manual control and is not available for Dispatch.
(10)	If a QSE has not submitted a valid COP for any Generation Resource for any hour in the DAM or RUC Study Period, then the Generation Resource is considered to have a Resource Status as OUT thus not available for DAM awards or RUC commitments for those hours. 
(11)	If a COP is not available for any Resource for any hour from the current hour to the start of the DAM period or RUC study, then the Resource Status for those hours are considered equal to the last known Resource Status from a previous hour’s COP or from telemetry as appropriate for that Resource.
(12)	A QSE representing a Resource may only use the Resource Status code of EMR for a Resource whose operation would have impacts that cannot be monetized and reflected through the Resource’s Energy Offer Curve or recovered through the RUC make-whole process or if the Resource has been contracted by ERCOT under Section 3.14.1 or under paragraph (4) of Section 6.5.1.1.  If ERCOT chooses to commit an Off-Line unit with EMR Resource Status that has been contracted by ERCOT under Section 3.14.1 or under paragraph (4) of Section 6.5.1.1, the QSE shall change its Resource Status to ONRUC.  Otherwise, the QSE shall change its Resource Status to ONEMR.

(16)	A QSE representing a Self-Limiting Facility must ensure that the sum of the COP HSL/LSL and the sum of the telemetered HSL/LSL submitted for each Resource within the Self-Limiting Facility do not exceed either the limit on MW Injection or the limit on the MW Withdrawal established for the Self-Limiting Facility.
[NPRR1029:  Insert paragraph (17) below upon system implementation and renumber accordingly:]
(17)	A QSE representing a DC-Coupled Resource shall not submit an HSL that exceeds the inverter rating or the sum of the nameplate ratings of the generation component(s) of the Resource.
(17)	A QSE representing an ESR shall ensure that COP values for a given hour follow the following rules:
(a)	MinSOC is greater than or equal to the nameplate minimum MWh operating SOC limit;

3.9.2	Current Operating Plan Validation
(1)	ERCOT shall verify that each COP, on its submission, complies with the criteria described in Section 3.9.1, Current Operating Plan (COP) Criteria.  ERCOT shall notify the QSE by means of the Messaging System if the QSE’s COP fails to comply with the criteria described in Section 3.9.1 and this Section 3.9.2 for any reason.  The QSE must then resubmit the COP within the appropriate market timeline.
(2)	ERCOT may reject a COP that does not meet the criteria described in Section 3.9.1.
(3)	If a Resource is designated in the COP to provide Ancillary Service, then ERCOT shall verify that the COP complies with Section 3.16, Standards for Determining Ancillary Service Quantities.  The Ancillary Service Supply Responsibilities as indicated in the Ancillary Service Resource Responsibility submitted immediately before the end of the Adjustment Period are physically binding commitments for each QSE for the corresponding Operating Period. 
(4)	ERCOT shall notify the QSE if the sum of the Ancillary Service capacity designated in the COP for each hour, by service type, is less than the QSE’s Ancillary Service Supply Responsibility for each service type for that hour.  If the QSE does not correct the deficiency within one hour after receiving the notice from ERCOT, then ERCOT shall follow the procedures outlined in Section 6.4.9.1, Evaluation and Maintenance of Ancillary Service Capacity Sufficiency. 
(5)	A QSE may change Ancillary Service Resource designations by changing its COP, subject to Section 6.4.9.1. 
(6)	If ERCOT determines that it needs more Ancillary Service during the Adjustment Period, then the QSE’s allocated portion of the additional Ancillary Service may be self-arranged.  
[NPRR1007:  Delete paragraphs (3)-(6) above upon system implementation of the Real-Time Co-Optimization (RTC) project and renumber accordingly.]
(7)	ERCOT systems must be able to detect a change in status of a Resource shown in the COP and must provide notice to ERCOT operators of changes that a QSE makes to its COP.

[NPRR857:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation and satisfying the following conditions: (1) Southern Cross provides ERCOT with funds to cover the entire estimated cost of the project; and (2) Southern Cross has signed an interconnection agreement with a TSP and the TSP gives ERCOT written notice that Southern Cross has provided it with:  (a) Notice to proceed with the construction of the interconnection; and (b) The financial security required to fund the interconnection facilities:]
(1)	ERCOT shall use the physical characteristics, ratings, and operational limits of all Transmission Elements of the ERCOT Transmission Grid and other information from Transmission Service Providers (TSPs), Direct Current Tie Operators (DCTOs), and Resource Entities to specify limits within which the transmission network is defined in the network models made available to Market Participants as noted below and used to operate the ERCOT Transmission Grid as updated.  If a Private Use Network is not registered as a Resource Entity, then ERCOT shall use equivalent model data provided by TSPs, if available, that represents the Private Use Network in the TSPs’ modeling systems for use in the Network Operations Model.
(2)	Because the ERCOT market requires accurate modeling of Transmission Elements in order to send accurate Base Points and pricing signals to Market Participants, ERCOT shall manage the Network Operations Model.  By providing Base Points and pricing signals by Electrical Bus to Market Participants, the Market Participants’ responses result in power flows on all Transmission Elements that ERCOT must monitor and, if necessary for reliability reasons, manage within ratings provided by the TSP and Resource Entity and limits assigned by ERCOT including Generic Transmission Limits (GTLs) as may be defined in Section 3.10.7.6, Use of Generic Transmission Constraints and Generic Transmission Limits.

(3)	Each TSP, DCTO, and Resource Entity shall provide ERCOT with equipment ratings and update the ratings as required by ERCOT.  ERCOT may request that a TSP, DCTO, or Resource Entity provide detailed information on the methodology, including data for determination of each requested rating.  ERCOT may review and comment on the methodology.  ERCOT shall post all methodologies on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area within seven days following a change in methodology. 
(4)	ERCOT must use system ratings consistent with the ratings expected to be used during Real-Time for the system condition being modeled, including Dynamic Ratings using expected temperatures for those system conditions.  For each model, ERCOT shall post ratings and the ambient temperatures used to calculate the ratings on the MIS Secure Area when the model is published. 
(5)	ERCOT shall use consistent information within and between the various models used by ERCOT in a manner that yields consistent results.  For operational and planning models that are intended to represent the same system state the results should be consistent and the naming should be identical.  
(6)	ERCOT shall use a Network Operations Model Change Request (NOMCR) process to control all information entering the Network Operations Model.  In order to allow for construction schedules, each NOMCR must be packaged as a single package describing any incremental changes and referencing any prerequisite NOMCRs, using an industry standard data exchange format.  A package must contain a series of instructions that define the changes that need to be made to implement a network model change.  ERCOT shall verify each package for completeness and accuracy prior to the period it is to be implemented.  
(7)	ERCOT shall use an automated process to manage the Common Information Model (CIM) compliant packages loaded into the Network Operations Model as each construction phase is completed.  ERCOT shall reject any NOMCRs that are not CIM compliant.  Each CIM compliant NOMCR must also be associated with commands to update the graphical displays associated with the network model modification.  During the testing phase, each NOMCR must be tested for proper sequencing and its effects on downstream applications.
(8)	ERCOT shall track each data submittal received from TSPs via the NOMCR process and from Resource Entities via the Resource Registration process.  Resource Registration data is converted by ERCOT to the appropriate NOMCR format through implementation and final testing of the change.

3.10.2	Annual Planning Model 
(1)	For each of the next six years, ERCOT shall develop models for annual planning purposes that contain, as much as practicable, information consistent with the Network Operations Model.  The “Annual Planning Model” for each of the next six years is a model of the ERCOT power system (created, approved, posted, and updated regularly by ERCOT) as it is expected to operate during peak Load conditions for the corresponding future year.
(2)	By October 15th of each year, ERCOT shall update, for each of the next six years, the ERCOT Planning Model and post it to the MIS Secure Area
(3)	ERCOT shall make available to TSPs and/or Distribution Service Provider (DSPs) and all appropriate Market Participants, consistent with the requirements regarding ECEII set forth in Section 1.3, Confidentiality, the transmission model used in transmission planning.  ERCOT shall provide model information through the use of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) sponsored CIM and web-based Extensible Markup Language (XML) communications or Power System Simulator for Engineering (PSS/E) format.

ERCOT shall provide model information through the use of the EPRI and NERC-sponsored CIM and web based XML communications or PSS/E format.
3.10.3.1	Process for Managing Network Operations Model Updates for Point of Interconnection Bus Changes, Resource Retirements and Deletion of DC Tie Load Zones 
(1)	Following the permanent change in Point of Interconnection Bus (POIB) of all Resources associated with a Resource Node, ERCOT shall retain the associated Settlement Point in the Network Operations Model at its existing location, an electrically similar location, or until all outstanding CRRs associated with that Settlement Point have expired as determined in accordance with the Other Binding Document, “Procedure for Identifying Resource Nodes.”  Following the retirement of all Resources associated with a Resource Node, ERCOT shall move the Resource Node to a proxy Electrical Bus.  The proxy Electrical Bus will be selected by finding the nearest energized Electrical Bus with the least impedance equipment between the existing Resource Node and the proxy Electrical Bus.  For purposes of the CRR Auction model for calendar periods that are prior to the expiration date of all CRRs associated with the Settlement Point, the Settlement Point will continue to be available as a sink or source for CRR Auction transaction submittals.  For calendar periods that are beyond the expiration date of all CRRs associated with the Settlement Point, the Settlement Point will not be available for transaction submittals in the associated CRR Auctions.  The Settlement Point will be removed from the Network Operations Model once all associated CRRs have expired.
(2)	When a Direct Current Tie (DC Tie) is to be permanently removed from service, ERCOT will delete the associated DC Tie Load Zone from the Network Operations Model after all outstanding CRRs associated with that DC Tie Load Zone have expired.  The DC Tie Load Zone will continue to be available as a sink or source Settlement Point for transaction submittals in CRR Auctions for calendar periods that are prior to the scheduled deletion date of the DC Tie Load Zone; however, the DC Tie Load Zone will no longer be an available Settlement Point for transaction submittals in CRR Auctions for calendar periods that are after the scheduled deletion date of the DC Tie Load Zone.
3.10.4	ERCOT Responsibilities
(1)	ERCOT shall design, install, operate, and maintain its systems and establish applicable related processes to meet the State Estimator Standards for Transmission Elements that under typical system conditions potentially affect the calculation of Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) as described in Section 3.10.7.5, Telemetry Standards, and Section 3.10.9, State Estimator Standards.  ERCOT shall post all documents relating to the State Estimator Standards on the MIS Secure Area.
(2)	During Real-Time, ERCOT shall calculate LMPs and take remedial actions to ensure that actual flow on a given Transmission Element is less than the Normal Rating and any calculated flow due to a contingency is less than the applicable Emergency Rating and 15-Minute Rating.
(3)	ERCOT shall install Network Operations Model test facilities that will accommodate execution of a test Real-Time sequence and preliminary test LMP calculator to demonstrate the correct operation of new Network Operations Models prior to releasing the model to Market Participants for detail testing and verification.  The Network Operations Model test facilities support power flow and contingency analyses to test the data set representation of a proposed transmission model update and simulate LMP calculations using typical test data.
(4)	ERCOT shall install EMS test and simulation facilities that accommodate execution of the State Estimator and LMP calculator, respectively.  These facilities will be used to conduct tests prior to placing a new model into ERCOT’s production environment to verify the new model’s accuracy.  The EMS test facilities allow a potential model to be tested before replacing the current production environment model.  The EMS test and simulation facilities must perform Real-Time security analysis to test a proposed transmission model before replacing the current production environment model. The EMS State Estimator test facilities must have Real-Time ICCP links to test the state estimation function using actual Real-Time conditions.  The EMS LMP test facilities must accept data uploads from the production environment providing Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) Resource offers, and telemetry via ICCP.  If the production data are unavailable, ERCOT may employ a data simulation tool or process to develop test data sets for the LMP test facilities.  For TSPs, ERCOT shall acquire model comparison software that will show all differences between subsequent versions of the Network Operations Model and shall make this information available to TSPs only within one week following test completion.  For non-TSP Market Participants, ERCOT shall post the differences within one week following test completion between subsequent versions of the Redacted Network Operations Model on the MIS Secure Area.  This comparison shall indicate differences in device parameters, missing or new devices, and status changes.
(5)	When implementing Transmission Element changes, ERCOT shall correct errors uncovered during testing that are due to submission of inaccurate information.  Each TSP and Resource Entity shall provide reasonably accurate information at the time of the original submission.  
[NPRR857:  Replace paragraph (5) above with the following upon system implementation and satisfying the following conditions: (1) Southern Cross provides ERCOT with funds to cover the entire estimated cost of the project; and (2) Southern Cross has signed an interconnection agreement with a TSP and the TSP gives ERCOT written notice that Southern Cross has provided it with:  (a) Notice to proceed with the construction of the interconnection; and (b) The financial security required to fund the interconnection facilities:]

In setting these limits for a given hour, ERCOT shall assume that any Generation Resource shown to be available in its COP will be self-committed or committed at the appropriate time through the Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) process to resolve any transmission constraints resulting from DC Tie Schedules.  DC Tie Schedules are subject to the actual availability of that generation at the time the Generation Resource is needed, as well as other system conditions.
[NPRR825:  Replace Section 3.10.7.7 above with the following upon system implementation:]
3.10.7.7	DC Tie Advisory Limits

(i)	The number of Transmission Elements connected to a given transmission voltage Electrical Bus;
(ii)	The peak demand of the Load connected to a transmission voltage Electrical Bus;
(iii)	The total of Resource capacity connected to a transmission voltage Electrical Bus;
(iv)	The nominal transmission voltage level of an Electrical Bus;
(v)	The number of Electrical Buses with injections or withdrawals along a circuit between currently monitored transmission voltage Electrical Bus;
(vi)	Connection of Loads along a continuous, non-branching circuit that may be combined for modeling purposes;
(vii)	The quantity of Load at an Electrical Bus that may have its connection to the transmission system automatically transferred to an Electrical Bus other than the one to which it is normally connected (rollover operation);
(vii)	Electrical proximity to more than one Resource Node;
(viii)	Degree or quality of continued observability following the loss of telemetry measurements resulting from a common mode failure of telemetry-related equipment (i.e., an N-1 telemetry condition); and
(ix)	Other parameters or circumstances, as appropriate;
(c)	Sensitivity of State Estimator results with respect to variations in input parameters;
(d)	Reasonable safeguards to assure State Estimator results are calculated on a non-discriminatory basis; and
(e)	Other parameters as deemed appropriate.
3.10.9.2	State Estimator Data
(1)	ERCOT uses a State Estimator to produce Load flow base cases, which are used to analyze the reliability of the ERCOT Transmission Grid.  Accurate and redundant telemetry and an accurate transmission power system model are required by the State Estimator in order to produce an optimal estimation of the transmission power system state.  State Estimator results are used in contingency analysis, congestion management, and other network analysis Real-Time sequence functions.
3.10.9.3	Telemetry Status and Analog Measurements Data
(1)	Good telemetry status and analog measurements data for the transmission power system together with an accurate model of the ERCOT System are processed by the State Estimator to provide an optimal estimate of the ERCOT System state at a given point in time while filtering minor measurement errors and detecting gross errors.  The quality and availability of telemetry provided to ERCOT is important to the performance of the ERCOT State Estimator.
(2)	Telemetry is not needed at every node of the ERCOT System to arrive at a good estimate of the ERCOT System’s state. State Estimator performance must meet the performance requirements set forth in Section 3.10.9.4, State Estimator Performance Requirements, unless otherwise provided for in the Operating Guides.
(3)	Beyond general telemetry performance criteria there are more stringent criteria needed at locations where state estimates are critically important, including, but not limited to, locations where reliability, security, and market impacts are of heightened concern.
3.10.9.4	State Estimator Performance Requirements
(1)	The State Estimator shall converge 98% of runs during a one month period.
(2)	For MW flows on Transmission Elements identified by ERCOT as causing 80% of congestion costs in the latest year for which data is available, the residual difference between State Estimator results and power flow results shall be less than 3% of the associated element Emergency Rating on at least 95% of samples measured in a one month period.  
(3)	For Transmission Elements identified by ERCOT as causing 80% of all congestion costs in the latest year for which data is available, the difference between the telemetry value (MW) and the State Estimator value (MW) shall be less than 3% of the associated element Emergency Rating on at least 95% of samples measured in a one month period. 
(4)	For the 20 most important station voltage points, as designated by ERCOT and approved by ROS, the telemetered voltage minus State Estimator voltage shall be within 2% of the telemetered voltage measurement for at least 95% of samples measured during a one month period.  
(5)	For all Transmission Elements 100 kV and above, the difference between the State Estimator solution (MW) and the SCADA measurement will be less than ten MW or 10% of the associated Emergency Rating (whichever is greater) on 99.5% of samples measured during a one month period.  ERCOT shall report all equipment failing this test to the associated TSP who shall repair such equipment no later than ten days following detection by ERCOT.
(6)	ERCOT shall post the State Estimator performance requirements contained in this Section on the MIS Secure Area.
3.10.9.5	ERCOT Directives
(1)	ERCOT shall work with the TSP or QSE to resolve telemetry and/or model problems in accordance with telemetry requirements prior to directing additional equipment.
(2)	In the event of failure to meet the requirements in paragraphs (2) or (3) of Section 3.10.9.4, State Estimator Performance Requirements, ERCOT may direct additional telemetry to be installed on elements contributing most to 80% of congestion costs for the latest year for which data is available.  If the TSP or QSE disputes the request for additional telemetry, pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 3.10.7.5.9, ERCOT Requests for Telemetry, the TSP or QSE may provide an alternative proposal.
(3)	ERCOT shall enforce the requirements of paragraph (5) of Section 3.10.7.5.2, Continuous Telemetry of the Real-Time Measurements of Bus Load, Voltages, Tap Position, and Flows, by alarming any sum of flow around a bus that is more than (a) 5% of the largest normal line rating connected to the bus, or (b) five MW, whichever is greater, and requesting that the applicable TSP or QSE correct the failure.
(4)	ERCOT shall consider the quality codes sent by the data provider in determining how confidence factors are assigned for the data to be used in the State Estimator.  Valid and manual quality codes as defined in Section 3.10.7.5.8.1, Data Quality Codes, shall be considered as good quality.  Quality codes sent as not good quality shall be considered at a lower confidence.
3.10.9.6	Telemetry and State Estimator Performance Monitoring
(1)	ERCOT shall monitor the performance of the State Estimator, Network Security Analysis, SCED, and LMP Calculator.  ERCOT shall post a monthly report of these items on the MIS Secure Area.  ERCOT shall notify affected TSPs and QSEs of any lapses of observability of the transmission system.
[NPRR857:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation and satisfying the following conditions: (1) Southern Cross provides ERCOT with funds to cover the entire estimated cost of the project; and (2) Southern Cross has signed an interconnection agreement with a TSP and the TSP gives ERCOT written notice that Southern Cross has provided it with:  (a) Notice to proceed with the construction of the interconnection; and (b) The financial security required to fund the interconnection facilities:]
(1)	ERCOT shall monitor the performance of the State Estimator, Network Security Analysis, SCED, and LMP Calculator.  ERCOT shall post a monthly report of these items on the MIS Secure Area.  ERCOT shall notify affected TSPs, QSEs, or DCTOs of any lapses of observability of the transmission system.
3.11	Transmission Planning
3.11.1	Overview
(1)	Project endorsement through the ERCOT regional planning process is intended to support, to the extent applicable, a finding by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) that a project is necessary for the service, accommodation, convenience, or safety of the public within the meaning of Public Utility Regulatory Act, TEX. UTIL. CODE ANN. § 37.056 (Vernon 1998 and Supp. 2007) (PURA) and P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.101, Certification Criteria. 
3.11.2	Planning Criteria
(1)	ERCOT and Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) shall evaluate the need for transmission system improvements and shall evaluate the relative value of alternative improvements based on established technical and economic criteria. 
(2)	The technical reliability criteria are established by the Planning Guide, Operating Guides, and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) Reliability Standards.  ERCOT and TSPs shall strongly endeavor to meet these criteria, identify current and future violations thereof and initiate solutions necessary to ensure continual compliance.
(3)	ERCOT shall attempt to meet these reliability criteria as economically as possible and shall actively study the need for economic projects to meet this goal.  
(4)	For economic projects, the net economic benefit of a proposed project, or set of projects, will be assessed over the project’s life based on the net societal benefit that is reasonably expected to accrue from the project.  The project will be recommended if it is reasonably expected to result in positive net societal benefits.  
(5)	To determine the societal benefit of a proposed project, the revenue requirement of the capital cost of the project is compared to the expected savings in system production costs resulting from the project over the expected life of the project.  Indirect benefits and costs associated with the project should be considered as well, where appropriate.  The current set of financial assumptions upon which the revenue requirement calculations is based will be reviewed annually, updated as necessary by ERCOT, and posted on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area.  The expected production costs are based on a chronological simulation of the security-constrained unit commitment and economic dispatch of the generators connected to the ERCOT Transmission Grid to serve the expected ERCOT System Load over the planning horizon.  This market simulation is intended to provide a reasonable representation of how the ERCOT System is expected to be operated over the simulated time period.  From a practical standpoint, it is not feasible to perform this production cost simulation for the entire 30 to 40 year expected life of the project.  Therefore, the production costs are projected over the period for which a simulation is feasible and a qualitative assessment is made of whether the factors driving the production cost savings due to the project can reasonably be expected to continue.  If so, the levelized ERCOT-wide annual production cost savings over the period for which the simulation is feasible is calculated and compared to the first year annual revenue requirement of the transmission project.  If this production cost savings equals or exceeds this annual revenue requirement for the project, the project is economic from a societal perspective and will be recommended.
[NPRR1183:  Replace paragraph (5) above with the following upon system implementation:]

If this production cost savings equals or exceeds this annual revenue requirement for the project, the project is economic from a societal perspective and will be recommended.
(6)	Other indicators based on analyses of ERCOT System operations may be considered as appropriate in the determination of benefits.  In order for such an alternate indicator to be considered, the costs must be reasonably expected to be on-going and be adequately quantifiable and unavoidable given the physical limitation of the transmission system.  These alternate indicators include:
(a)	Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) Settlement for unit operations;
(b)	Visible ERCOT market indicators such as clearing prices of Congestion Revenue Rights (CRRs); and
(c)	Actual Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) and observed congestion.
3.11.3	Regional Planning Group
(1)	ERCOT shall lead and facilitate a Regional Planning Group (RPG) to consider and review proposed projects to address transmission constraints and other ERCOT System needs.  The RPG will be a non-voting, consensus-based organization focused on identifying needs, identifying potential solutions, communicating varying viewpoints and reviewing analyses related to the ERCOT Transmission Grid in the planning horizon.  Participation in the RPG is required of all TSPs and is open to all Market Participants, consumers, other stakeholders, and PUCT Staff.  
3.11.4	Regional Planning Group Project Review Process
3.11.4.1	Project Submission
(1)	Any stakeholder may initiate an RPG Project Review through the submission of a document describing the scope of the proposed transmission project to ERCOT.  Projects should be submitted with sufficient lead-time to allow the RPG Project Review to be completed prior to the date on which the project must be initiated by the designated TSP.  
(2)	Stakeholders may submit projects for RPG Project Review within any project Tier.  All transmission projects in Tiers 1, 2 and 3 shall be submitted.  TSPs are not required to submit Tier 4 projects for RPG Project Review, but shall include any Tier 4 projects in the cases used for development of the Regional Transmission Plan. 
(3)	All system improvements that are necessary for the project to achieve the system performance improvement, or to correct the system performance deficiency, for which the project is intended should be included into a single project submission.
(4) 	Facility ratings updates are not considered a project and are not subject to RPG Project Review.
3.11.4.2	Project Comment Process
(1)	ERCOT shall conduct a comment process which is open to the stakeholders for all proposed Tier 1, 2 and 3 projects.  The proposer of the project will have a reasonable period of time, as established by ERCOT, to answer questions and respond to comments submitted during this process.  The Planning Guide provides details of this process. 
3.11.4.3	Categorization of Proposed Transmission Projects
(1)	ERCOT classifies all proposed transmission projects into one of four categories (or Tiers).  Each Tier is defined so that projects with a similar cost and impact on reliability and the ERCOT market are grouped into the same Tier.  For Tier classification, the total estimated cost of the project shall be used which includes costs borne by another party.
(a) 	A project shall be classified as Tier 1 if the estimated capital cost is greater than or equal to $100,000,000, unless the project is considered to be a neutral project pursuant to paragraph (f) below.
(b)	A project shall be classified as Tier 2 if the estimated capital cost is less than $100,000,000 and a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN) is required, unless the project is considered to be a neutral project pursuant to paragraph (f) below.
(c)	A project shall be classified as Tier 3 if any of the following are true:
(i)	The estimated capital cost is less than $100,000,000 and greater than or equal to $25,000,000 and a CCN is not required, unless the project is considered to be a neutral project pursuant to paragraph (f) below; or
(ii)	The estimated capital cost is less than $25,000,000, a CCN is not required, and the project includes 345 kV circuit reconductor of more than one mile, additional 345/138 kV autotransformer capacity, or a new 345 kV substation, unless the project is considered to be a neutral project pursuant to paragraph (f) below.
(d)	A project with an estimated capital cost greater than or equal to $25,000,000 that is proposed for the purpose of replacing aged infrastructure or storm hardening shall be processed as a Tier 3 project and shall be reclassified as a Tier 4, neutral project upon ERCOT’s determination that any concerns, questions or objections raised during the comment process have been resolved satisfactorily.
(e)	A project shall be classified as Tier 4 if it does not meet the requirements to be classified as Tier 1, 2, or 3 or if it is considered a neutral project pursuant to paragraph (f) below.
(f)	A project shall be considered a neutral project if it consists entirely of:
(i)	The addition of or upgrades to radial transmission circuits; 
(ii)	The addition of equipment that does not affect the transfer capability of a circuit;
(iii)	Repair and replacement-in-kind projects; 
(iv)	Transmission Facilities needed to connect a new Generation Resource, Energy Storage Resource (ESR), or Settlement Only Generator (SOG) to a new or existing substation on the existing ERCOT Transmission Grid, including the substation; 
(v)	The addition of static reactive devices; 
(vi)	A project to serve a new Load, unless such project would create a new transmission circuit connection between two stations (other than looping an existing circuit into the new Load-serving station);
(vii)	Replacement of failed equipment, even if it results in a ratings and/or impedance change; or
(viii)	Equipment upgrades resulting in only ratings changes.
(2)	ERCOT may use its reasonable judgment to increase the level of review of a proposed project (e.g., from Tier 3 to Tier 2) from that which would be strictly indicated by these criteria, based on stakeholder comments, ERCOT analysis or the system impacts of the project.
(a) 	A project with an estimated capital cost greater than or equal to $50,000,000 that requires a CCN shall be reclassified and processed as a Tier 1 project upon request by a Market Participant during the comment period per Planning Guide Section 3.1.5, Regional Planning Group Comment Process.
(3)	Any project that would be built by an Entity that is exempt (e.g., a Municipally Owned Utility (MOU)) from getting a CCN for transmission projects but would require a CCN if it were to be built by a regulated Entity will be treated as if the project would require a CCN for the purpose of defining the Tier of the project.
(4)	If during the course of ERCOT’s independent review of a project, the project scope changes, ERCOT may reclassify the project into the appropriate Tier.
3.11.4.4	Processing of Tier 4 Projects
(1)	For any project classified in Tier 4, ERCOT will not solicit comments from RPG, conduct any independent review, or provide any endorsement for the project. 
3.11.4.5	Processing of Tier 3 Projects
(1)	ERCOT shall accept a Tier 3 project if no concerns, questions or objections are provided during the project comment process.
(2)	If reasonable ERCOT or stakeholder concerns about a Tier 3 project cannot be resolved during the time period allotted by ERCOT, the project may be processed as a Tier 2 project, unless ERCOT assesses that reasonable progress is being made toward resolving these concerns.
3.11.4.6	Processing of Tier 2 Projects
(1)	ERCOT shall conduct an independent review of a submitted Tier 2 project as follows:
(a)	ERCOT’s independent review shall consist of studies and analyses necessary for ERCOT to make its assessment of whether the proposed project is needed and whether the proposed project is the preferred solution to the identified system performance deficiency that the project is intended to resolve;
(b)	ERCOT shall consider all comments received during the project comment process and factor reasonable comments into its independent review of the project;
(c)	ERCOT will attempt to complete its independent review for a project in 120 days or less.  If ERCOT is unable to complete its independent review based on RPG input within 120 days, ERCOT shall notify the RPG of the expected completion time;
(d)	ERCOT may, at its discretion, discuss submitted transmission projects at meetings of the RPG in order to obtain additional input into its independent review; and
(e)	ERCOT shall prepare a written report documenting the results of its independent review and recommendation on the project and shall distribute this report to the RPG.
3.11.4.7	Processing of Tier 1 Projects
(1)	ERCOT shall conduct an independent review of a submitted Tier 1 project as follows:
(a)	ERCOT’s independent review will consist of studies and analyses necessary for ERCOT to make its assessment of whether the proposed project is needed and whether the proposed project is the preferred solution to the identified system performance deficiency that the project is intended to resolve;
(b)	ERCOT will consider all comments received during the project comment process and factor reasonable comments into its independent review of the project;
(c)	ERCOT will attempt to complete its independent review for a project in 150 days or less.  If ERCOT is unable to complete its independent review based on RPG input within 150 days, ERCOT shall notify the RPG of the expected completion time;
(d)	ERCOT may, at its discretion, discuss submitted transmission projects at meetings of the RPG in order to obtain additional input into its independent review; and
(e)	ERCOT shall prepare a written report documenting the results of its independent review and recommendation on the project and shall distribute this report to the RPG.
(2)	Tier 1 projects require ERCOT Board endorsement.
3.11.4.8	Determine Designated Providers of Transmission Additions
(1)	Upon completion of an independent review, ERCOT shall determine the designated TSPs for any recommended transmission additions.  The designated TSP for a recommended transmission addition will be the TSP that owns the end point(s) of the recommended transmission addition.  The designated TSP can agree to provide the recommended transmission addition or delegate the responsibility to another TSP.  If different TSPs own the two end points of a recommended transmission addition, ERCOT will designate them as co-providers of the recommended transmission addition, and they can decide between themselves what parts of the recommended transmission addition they will each provide.  If they cannot agree, ERCOT will determine their responsibility following a meeting with the parties.  If a designated TSP agrees to provide a recommended transmission addition but does not diligently pursue the recommended transmission addition (during the time frame before a CCN is filed, if required) in a manner that will meet the required in-service date, then upon concurrence of the ERCOT Board, ERCOT will solicit interest from TSPs through the RPG and will designate an alternate TSP.
3.11.4.9	Regional Planning Group Acceptance and ERCOT Endorsement
(1)	For Tier 3 projects, successful resolution of all comments received from ERCOT and stakeholders during the project comment process will result in RPG acceptance of the proposed project.  An RPG acceptance letter shall be sent to the TSP(s) for the project, the project submitter (if different from the TSP(s)), and posted on the MIS Secure Area.  For Tier 2 projects, ERCOT’s recommendation as a result of its independent review of the proposed project will constitute ERCOT endorsement of the need for a project except as noted in paragraph (4) below.  For Tier 1 projects, ERCOT’s endorsement is obtained upon affirmative vote of the ERCOT Board except as noted in paragraph (4) below.  An ERCOT endorsement letter shall be sent to the TSP(s) for the project, the project submitter (if different from the TSP(s)), and the PUCT, and posted on the MIS Secure Area upon receipt of ERCOT’s endorsement for Tier 1 and Tier 2 projects except as noted in paragraph (4) below.
(2)	Following the completion of its independent review, ERCOT shall present all Tier 1 projects for which it finds a need to the ERCOT Board and shall provide a report to the ERCOT Board explaining the basis for its determination of need.  Prior to presenting the project to the ERCOT Board, ERCOT shall present the project to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) for review and comment.  Comments from TAC shall be included in the presentation to the ERCOT Board.  ERCOT will make a reasonable effort to make these presentations to TAC and the ERCOT Board at the next regularly scheduled meetings following completion of its independent review of the project.
(3)	If the asserted need for a Tier 1 or Tier 2 project is based on a service request from a specific customer, a TSP may submit the project for RPG Project Review prior to that customer signing a letter agreement for the financial security of the necessary upgrades.  However, ERCOT shall not issue an independent review recommending such a project until the customer signs any required letter agreement, provides any required notice to proceed, and provides the full amount of any financial security required for the upgrades needed to serve that customer.
(4)	If a TSP asserts a need for a proposed Tier 1 or Tier 2 project based in part or in whole on its own planning criteria, then ERCOT's independent review shall also consider whether a reliability need exists under the TSP’s criteria.  If ERCOT identifies a reliability need under the TSP’s criteria, then ERCOT shall recommend a project that would address that need as well as any reliability need identified under NERC or ERCOT criteria, but shall explicitly state in the independent review report that ERCOT has assumed the TSP’s criteria are valid and that an assessment of the validity of the TSP’s criteria is beyond the scope of ERCOT’s responsibility.  ERCOT or the ERCOT Board may provide a qualified endorsement of such a project if ERCOT determines that it is justified in part under ERCOT or NERC criteria, as described in paragraph (1) above.  However, neither ERCOT nor the ERCOT Board shall endorse a project that is determined to be needed solely to meet a TSP’s criteria.
3.11.4.10	Modifications to ERCOT Endorsed Projects
(1)	If the TSP for an ERCOT-endorsed project determines a need to make a significant change to the facilities included in the project (such as the line endpoint(s), number of circuits, voltage level, decrease in rating or similar major aspect of the project), the TSP shall notify ERCOT of the details of that change prior to filing a CCN application, if required, or prior to beginning the final design of the project if no CCN application is required.  If ERCOT concurs that the proposed change is significant, the change shall be processed as a Tier 3 project, unless ERCOT determines the project should more appropriately be processed in another Tier.
(2) 	For economic-driven projects, if a TSP determines that the estimated project cost has increased by more than 10% over the cost described in ERCOT’s endorsement, the TSP shall notify RPG prior to filing a CCN application if required, or prior to beginning the final design of the project if no CCN application is required, and provide an explanation for the cost increase.  For comparison purposes, the cost of the route that best meets PUCT criteria will be used.
3.11.4.11	Customer or Resource Entity Funded Transmission Projects
(1)       If an affected TSP elects to pursue a Customer or Resource Entity funded transmission project that would have been classified as a Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3 project for RPG Project Review, the TSP(s) shall conduct a reliability impact assessment of the proposed transmission project and shall submit a report summarizing the results of the reliability impact assessment for RPG Project Review.  Such projects shall be processed according to their Tier classification and shall be reclassified as a Tier 4, neutral project upon ERCOT’s determination that any concerns, questions or objections raised during the comment process have been resolved satisfactorily. 
(2)	ERCOT’s independent review of a Tier 1 or Tier 2 Customer or Resource Entity funded transmission project will be limited to assessing the reliability and congestion impact of the proposed project and submitting a report summarizing the results and findings to RPG for review and discussion.  ERCOT will not endorse the project and will not present the project to the ERCOT Board.  However, ERCOT may recommend the project not be implemented or recommend changes to the project scope if, in ERCOT’s sole discretion, the project negatively impacts the reliability or congestion of the ERCOT System.
(3)	Customer or Resource Entity funded Tier 4 projects do not need to go through this review process.
3.11.5	Transmission Service Provider and Distribution Service Provider Access to Interval Data
(1)	ERCOT shall provide specific interval data for Load and generation to TSPs and/or Distribution Service Providers (DSPs), upon request, in accordance with confidentiality as defined in Section 1.3, Confidentiality.
(a)	The TSP’s and/or DSP’s request for interval data shall identify the reason for requesting the information in regards to impact to the planning process (e.g. build power flow cases, conduct a specific study, etc.).
(b)	ERCOT shall evaluate the TSP and/or DSP request and validate reasons provided. 
(c)	Upon ERCOT validation of the TSP and/or DSP request, the data provided shall include meter data measured at points of injection and points of delivery which will measurably impact the TSP’s and/or DSP’s planning and operations as determined by ERCOT (e.g., determination of the TSP’s and/or DSP’s system Load or power flows). 
(d) 	If ERCOT determines that the request is invalid and denies it, ERCOT shall provide the reasoning for denying the request.
3.11.6	Generation Interconnection Process
(1)	The generation interconnection process facilitates the interconnection of new generation units in the ERCOT Region by assessing the transmission upgrades necessary for new generating units to operate reliably.  The process to study interconnecting new generation or modifying an existing generation interconnection to the ERCOT Transmission Grid is covered in the Planning Guide.  The generation interconnection study process primarily addresses the direct connection of generation Facilities to the ERCOT Transmission Grid and directly-related projects.  Projects that are identified through this process and are regional in nature may be reviewed through the RPG Project Review process upon recommendation by the TSP or ERCOT, subject to the confidentiality provisions in Section 1.3, Confidentiality.
(2)	ERCOT shall perform an independent economic analysis of the Transmission Facilities needed to connect a new Generation Resource, ESR, or SOG to a new or existing substation on the existing ERCOT Transmission Grid, including the substation, that are identified through this process that are expected to cost more than $25,000,000.  This economic analysis is performed only for informational purposes; as such, no ERCOT endorsement will be provided.  The results of the economic analysis shall be included in the interconnection study posting.
(3)	Additional upgrades to the ERCOT Transmission Grid that might be cost-effective as a result of new or modified generation may be initiated by any stakeholder through the RPG Project Review procedure described in Section 3.11.4, Regional Planning Group Project Review Process, at the appropriate time, subject to the confidentiality provisions of the generation interconnection procedure.
3.12	Load Forecasting
(1)	ERCOT shall produce and use Load forecasts to serve operations and planning objectives.  
(a)	ERCOT shall update and post hourly on the ERCOT website, a “Seven-Day Load Forecast” as described in Section 3.12.1, Seven-Day Load Forecast, that provides forecasted hourly Load over the next 168 hours for each of the Weather Zones and for each of the Forecast Zones.  
(b)	ERCOT shall develop and post monthly on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area a “36-Month Load Forecast” that provides a daily minimum and maximum Load forecast for the next 36-months for the ERCOT Region, for each of the Weather Zones, and for each of the Forecast Zones.  The 36-Month Load Forecast is used in the Outage coordination process and for Resource adequacy reporting.
[NPRR1004:  Insert paragraph (c) below upon system implementation:]
(c)	ERCOT shall generate and post daily on the ERCOT website Load distribution factors that provide hourly distribution for non-Private Use Network Loads by means of the Mid-Term Load Forecast (MTLF).  Private Use Network Loads will be generated separately.  If ERCOT decides, in its sole discretion, to change the Load distribution factors for reasons such as anticipated weather events or holidays, ERCOT shall select representative conditions as an input reasonably reflecting the anticipated Load in the Operating Day.  ERCOT may also modify the Load distribution factors to account for predicted differences in network topology between the Load forecast and Operating Day.  ERCOT may set auto error correction settings and apply Load forecast validation to better represent Load Profiles.  Private Use Network Load distribution factor data is redacted from the MIS postings and all self-serve Load’s distribution factors are set to zero when the data is used by the downstream applications.
(2)	ERCOT shall produce and post to the ERCOT website an Intra-Hour Load Forecast (IHLF) that provides a rolling two hour five minute forecast of ERCOT-wide Load.
3.12.1	Seven-Day Load Forecast
(1)	ERCOT shall use the Seven-Day Load Forecast to predict hourly Loads for the next 168 hours based on current weather forecast parameters within each Weather Zone.  Preparation for Day-Ahead Operations requires an accurate forecast of the Loads for which generation capacity must be secured.  The Seven-Day Load Forecast must have a “self-training” mode that allows ERCOT to review historic Load data and provide the ability to retrain the Seven-Day Load Forecast algorithm.
[NPRR975:  Insert paragraphs (a) and (b) below upon system implementation:]
(a) 	ERCOT will use a variety of Load forecast models and will select the Load forecast model that best fits the expected conditions for each hour of the next 168 hours as the Seven-Day Load Forecast for that hour and may update this selection as expected conditions change.    
(b)	If the selected forecast used at the time of the Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC) for the peak Demand hour of any of the next seven days is above or below the average of the forecast models for that hour by the greater of 2000 MW or 4% of the average of the forecast models for that hour, ERCOT shall produce and post to the ERCOT website an explanation of why the outlier Load forecast model was selected for that hour.
(2)	The inputs for the Seven-Day Load Forecast are as follows:
(a)	Hourly forecasted weather parameters for the weather stations within the Weather Zones, which are updated at least once per hour; and
(b)	Training information based on historic hourly integrated Weather Zone Loads.
(3)	ERCOT shall review the forecast suggested by Seven-Day Load Forecast and shall use its judgment, if necessary, to modify the result prior to implementation in the Ancillary Service Capacity Monitor, Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC), Hour-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (HRUC), and Resource adequacy reporting.
3.12.2	Study Areas
(1)	ERCOT shall develop and use Study Areas for Load forecasting and study purposes, and will provide the Load forecast data to the market.  A list of Study Areas shall be available on the ERCOT website.
3.12.3	Seven-Day Study Area Load Forecast
(1)	ERCOT shall develop and post hourly on the ERCOT website a “Seven-Day Study Area Load Forecast” to predict the hourly Loads for the next 168 hours based on current weather forecast parameters within each Study Area.  
(a)	The forecast referenced in paragraph (1) above will not affect the values within the “Seven-Day Load Forecast” by Weather Zone and/or Forecast Zone.
3.13	Renewable Production Potential Forecasts
(1)	ERCOT shall produce forecasts of Renewable Production Potential (RPP) for Wind-powered Generation Resources (WGRs) and PhotoVoltaic Generation Resources (PVGRs) to be used as an input into the Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC) and Hour-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (HRUC).  ERCOT shall produce the forecasts using information provided by WGR/PVGR Entities, meteorological information, and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).  WGR and PVGR Entities shall install telemetry at their respective Resources and transmit the ERCOT-specified site-specific meteorological information to ERCOT.  WGR and PVGR Entities shall also provide detailed equipment status at the WGR/PVGR facility as specified by ERCOT to support the RPP forecast.  ERCOT shall post forecasts for each WGR and PVGR to the Qualified Scheduling Entities (QSEs) representing WGRs and/or PVGRs on the Market Information System (MIS) Certified Area.  QSEs shall use the ERCOT-provided forecasts for WGRs/PVGRs throughout the Day-Ahead and Operating Day for applicable markets and Reliability Unit Commitments (RUCs).  Similar requirements for run-of-the-river hydro must be developed as needed. 
[NPRR1029:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(1)	ERCOT shall produce forecasts of Renewable Production Potential (RPP) for Wind-powered Generation Resources (WGRs), PhotoVoltaic Generation Resources (PVGRs), and the intermittent renewable generation component of each DC-Coupled Resource to be used as an input into the Day-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (DRUC) and Hour-Ahead Reliability Unit Commitment (HRUC).  ERCOT shall produce the forecasts using information provided by WGRs, PVGRs, and DC-Coupled Resources; meteorological information; and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).  A Resource Entity with a WGR, PVGR, or DC-Coupled Resource shall install equipment to enable telemetry of site-specific meteorological information that ERCOT determines is necessary to produce the RPP forecast, and the Resource Entity’s QSE shall telemeter such information and Resource status information to ERCOT.  ERCOT shall post forecasts for each WGR and PVGR and for the intermittent renewable generation component of each DC-Coupled Resource to the MIS Certified Area for the Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) representing that WGR, PVGR, or DC-Coupled Resource.  QSEs shall use the ERCOT-provided forecasts for WGRs, PVGRs, and DC-Coupled Resources in the Day-Ahead and throughout the Operating Day for applicable markets and Reliability Unit Commitments (RUCs).  Similar requirements for run-of-the-river hydro must be developed as needed.
(2)	ERCOT shall develop cost-effective tools or services to forecast energy production from Intermittent Renewable Resources (IRRs) with technical assistance from QSEs scheduling IRRs.  ERCOT shall use its best efforts to develop accurate and unbiased forecasts, as limited by the availability of relevant explanatory data.  ERCOT shall post on the MIS Secure Area objective criteria and thresholds for unbiased, accurate forecasts within five Business Days of change.

ERCOT shall post on the ERCOT website objective criteria and thresholds for unbiased, accurate forecasts within five Business Days of change.
3.14	Contracts for Reliability Resources and Emergency Response Service Resources
(1)	ERCOT shall procure Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Service, Black Start Service (BSS) or Emergency Response Service (ERS) through Agreements.
[NPRR885:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(1)	ERCOT shall procure Reliability Must-Run (RMR) Service, Must-Run Alternative (MRA) Service, Black Start Service (BSS), or Emergency Response Service (ERS) through Agreements.
3.14.1	Reliability Must Run
(1)	RMR Service is the use by ERCOT, under contracts with Resource Entities, of capacity and energy from Generation Resources that otherwise would not operate and that are necessary to provide voltage support, stability or management of localized transmission constraints under applicable reliability criteria, where market solutions do not exist.
(a)	Upon receiving a Notification of Suspension of Operations (NSO) from a Resource Entity as described in Section 3.14.1.1, Notification of Suspension of Operations, ERCOT may begin procurement of RMR Service under this Section.  
(b)	Before entering into an RMR Agreement, ERCOT shall assess alternatives to the proposed RMR Agreement.  ERCOT shall evaluate and present in a written report posted on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area the information in items (i) through (iv) below.  ERCOT is not limited in the number of additional scenarios it chooses to evaluate.  The written report shall include an explanation as to why the items below are insufficient, either alone or in combination, to fill the requirement that will be met by the potential RMR Unit.  The report shall be posted in the time frame required under paragraph (5) of Section 3.14.1.2, ERCOT Evaluation Process.  The list of alternatives ERCOT must consider includes (as reasonable for each type of reliability concern identified):
(i)	Re-dispatch/reconfiguration through operator instruction;
(ii)	Automatic Mitigation Plans (AMPs) and Remedial Action Plans (RAPs);
(iii)	Remedial Action Schemes (RASs) initiated on unit trips or Transmission Facilities’ Outages; and
(iv)	Any other operational alternatives deemed viable by ERCOT.
(c)	ERCOT shall minimize the use of RMR Units as much as practicable subject to the other provisions of these Protocols.  ERCOT may Dispatch an RMR Unit at any time for ERCOT System security.    
(d)	Each RMR Unit must meet technical requirements specified in Section 8.1.1.1, Ancillary Service Qualification and Testing.
(e)	ERCOT may execute RMR Agreements for no less than one month and no more than one year, with one exception.  ERCOT may execute an RMR Agreement for a term longer than 12 months if the Resource Entity must make a significant capital expenditure to meet environmental regulations or to ensure availability to continue operating the RMR Unit so as to make an RMR Agreement in excess of 12 months appropriate, in ERCOT’s opinion.  The term of a multi-year RMR Agreement must take into account the appropriate RMR exit strategy discussed in Section 3.14.1.4, Exit Strategy from an RMR Agreement.  In the event ERCOT chooses to contract for an RMR Unit for longer than one year, ERCOT shall annually re-evaluate the need for the RMR Unit under the criteria set forth in paragraph (b) above.  If ERCOT determines the RMR Unit is no longer needed, ERCOT shall enter into exit negotiations with the contract signatories to attempt to exit the contract early.  However, ERCOT shall not enter into such negotiations until a Market Notice is issued providing the anticipated RMR exit time frame.  The RMR standard Agreement is included in Section 22, Attachment B, Standard Form Reliability Must-Run Agreement.  ERCOT shall post each RMR Agreement in its entirety, including amendments or modifications thereto, within five Business Days of execution on the MIS Secure Area.
(f)	A Generation Resource is eligible for RMR status based on criteria established by ERCOT indicating its operation is necessary to support ERCOT System reliability according to the Operating Guides.  A combined-cycle generation Facility must be treated as a single unit for RMR purposes unless the combustion turbine and the steam turbine can operate separately.  If the steam turbine and combustion turbine can operate separately, and the steam turbine is powered by waste heat from more than one combustion turbine, the combustion turbine accepted for RMR Service and a proportionate part of the steam turbine must be treated as a single unit for RMR purposes.  If the combustion turbine accepted for RMR Service can operate separately from the steam turbine, and only the combustion turbine is accepted as an RMR Unit, the RMR energy price will be reduced by the value of the combustion turbine’s waste heat calculated at the Fuel Index Price (FIP), except when the steam turbine is Off-Line.  ERCOT shall post to the MIS Secure Area the criteria upon which it evaluates whether an RMR Unit meets the test of operational necessity to support ERCOT System reliability within five Business Days of change and shall issue a Market Notice stating the determination is available.  This includes the case where a unit previously identified by ERCOT as potentially needed for RMR Service is no longer needed regardless of whether an RMR Agreement was ever signed.

(g)	A Resource Entity cannot be compelled to enter into an RMR Agreement.  A Resource Entity that owns or controls a Generation Resource that is uneconomic to remain in service can voluntarily petition ERCOT for contracted RMR status by following the process in this subsection.  ERCOT shall determine whether the Generation Resource is necessary for system reliability based on the criteria set forth in this Section.
(h)	ERCOT must contract for the entire capacity of each RMR Unit.
(i)	ERCOT shall post on the MIS Secure Area all information relative to the use of RMR Units including energy deployed monthly.
(j)	The Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit may not use the RMR Unit for:
(i)	Participating in the bilateral energy market;
(ii)	Self-providing of energy except for plant auxiliary Load obligations under the RMR Agreement; and
(iii)	Providing of Ancillary Service to any Entity.
(k)	ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice on the need for an RMR Unit prior to entering negotiations for the RMR Unit.  Such Market Notice shall include the link to the ERCOT final RMR evaluation, the Resource name and unit code, the name of the Resource Entity, the name of the Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) for the Resource, the Resource MW rating by Season, and potential duration of the RMR Agreement, including anticipated start and end dates.
(l)	ERCOT shall, through the issuance of Market Notices, provide the same information, contemporaneously, about the need for, or elimination of an RMR Unit to all registered Market Participants, including QSEs and Resource Entities with RMR Units.
3.14.1.1	Notification of Suspension of Operations
(1)	Except for the occurrence of a Forced Outage, a Resource Entity must notify ERCOT in writing no less than 150 days prior to the date on which the Resource Entity intends to cease or suspend operation of a Generation Resource for a period of greater than 180 days.  If a Generation Resource is to be mothballed on a seasonal basis, the Resource Entity must notify ERCOT in writing no less than 90 days prior to the suspension date and identify its Seasonal Operation Period.  
(2)	The Resource Entity shall submit a completed Part I and Part II of the NSO (found in Section 22, Attachment E, Notification of Suspension of Operations).  The Resource Entity may also complete Part III of the NSO and submit it along with Parts I and II, or may wait to submit Part III up to ten days after ERCOT makes a determination that the proposed suspension of the Generation Resource would result in a performance deficiency for which the Generation Resource has a material impact.  Part I of the NSO must include the attestation of an officer of the Resource Entity that the Generation Resource is uneconomic to remain in service as currently designated and will be unavailable for Dispatch by ERCOT for a period specified in the NSO.  
(3)	A Resource Entity ceasing or suspending operations as a result of a Forced Outage lasting greater than 180 days shall notify ERCOT as soon as practicable by submitting an NSO.  If an NSO is submitted for a Generation Resource that is suspending operations for greater than 180 days due to a Forced Outage but is not indefinitely or permanently ceasing operations, then:
(a)	The Generation Resource will not be evaluated for RMR status;  
(b)	The NSO will not be posted on the MIS, except that information contained in the NSO may be included in reports in accordance with Section 3.2.6.2.2, Total Capacity Estimate; and
[NPRR1183:  Replace paragraph (b) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(b)	The NSO will not be posted on the ERCOT website, except that information contained in the NSO may be included in reports in accordance with Section 3.2.6.2.2, Total Capacity Estimate; and
(c)	ERCOT will not issue a Market Notice.
(4)	At least 60 days before the expiration of an existing RMR Agreement, the Resource Entity may apply to renew the RMR Agreement by submitting a new NSO (including both Part I and Part II).  Upon receipt of such a renewal request, ERCOT shall update and post to the MIS Secure Area studies as set forth in Section 3.14.1, Reliability Must Run, within 15 Business Days. 
3.14.1.2	ERCOT Evaluation Process
(1)	Except as provided in paragraph (3) of Section 3.14.1.1, Notification of Suspension of Operations, upon receipt of an NSO under Section 3.14.1.1 ERCOT shall post the NSO on the MIS Secure Area and shall post all existing relevant studies and data and provide a Market Notice of the NSO and posting of the studies and data.
[NPRR1183:  Replace paragraph (1) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(1)	Except as provided in paragraph (3) of Section 3.14.1.1, Notification of Suspension of Operations, upon receipt of an NSO under Section 3.14.1.1 ERCOT shall post the NSO on the ERCOT website and shall post on the MIS Secure Area all existing relevant studies and data and provide a Market Notice of the NSO and posting of the studies and data.
(2)	Within 21 days after receiving the NSO described in paragraph (1) above, unless otherwise notified by ERCOT that a shorter comment period is required, Market Participants may submit comments to ERCOT on whether the Generation Resource(s) referenced in the NSO is necessary to support ERCOT System reliability or should qualify for a multi-year RMR Agreement.  ERCOT shall consider and post all submitted comments on the MIS Secure Area.
(3)	ERCOT shall conduct a reliability analysis of the need for any Generation Resource(s) with a summer Seasonal net max sustainable rating greater than or equal to 20 MW to support ERCOT System reliability.  For Generation Resource(s) with a summer Seasonal net max sustainable rating less than 20 MW, ERCOT may conduct a reliability analysis if deemed appropriate by ERCOT following consultation with affected Transmission Service Provider(s) (TSP(s)).
(a)	ERCOT shall use a Load forecast consistent with current Regional Transmission Plan assumptions and methodologies for the appropriate season(s).  If additional new Generation Resources meet the criteria in Planning Guide Section 6.9, Addition of Proposed Generation to the Planning Models, ERCOT shall include those additional Generation Resources with the appropriate seasonal ratings.  
(b)	If the NSO indicates that the Generation Resource(s) will decommission or suspend operation, or in the case of a Forced Outage, has permanently ceased operation, ERCOT, in its sole discretion, may perform transmission reliability analysis over a planning horizon as defined by the available base cases but not to exceed two years.
(c)	For purposes of the reliability analysis, ERCOT shall use the following criteria to identify a performance deficiency that is materially impacted by the Generation Resource:
(i)	Without the Generation Resource, there are one or more Transmission Facilities loaded above their Normal Rating under pre-contingency conditions.
(ii)	Without the Generation Resource, there is any instability or cascading for any of the following conditions:
(A)	Pre-contingency;
(B)	Normal system conditions followed by the contingency loss of a generating unit, transmission circuit, common tower outage, transformer, shunt device, or flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) device;
(C)	Unavailability of a generating unit, followed by Manual System Adjustments, followed by the contingency loss of a generating unit, transmission circuit, common tower outage, transformer, shunt device, or FACTS device; or
(D)	Unavailability of a 345/138 kV transformer, followed by Manual System Adjustments, followed by the contingency loss of a generating unit, transmission circuit, common tower outage, transformer, shunt device, or FACTS device.
(iii)	Without the Generation Resource, there are one or more Transmission Facilities loaded above 110% of the Emergency Rating under normal system conditions followed by the contingency loss of a generating unit, transmission circuit, common tower outage, transformer, shunt device, or FACTS device.
(iv)	For paragraphs (i) through (iii) above, the Generation Resource will only be deemed to have a material impact on a performance deficiency that is caused by a thermal overload(s) if the Generation Resource has a more than 2% unloading Shift Factor on the Transmission Facility(s) that is overloaded and more than 5% unloading impact on the Transmission Facility(s) that is overloaded.  For purposes herein, an unloading impact is a measure of a reduction in flow on a Transmission Facility as a percent of its Rating due to a unit injection of power from the Generation Resource.
(v)	ERCOT may, in its sole discretion, deviate from the above criteria in order to maintain ERCOT System reliability.  However, ERCOT shall present its reasons for deviating from the above criteria to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and ERCOT Board.
(d)	ERCOT, in consultation with affected TSP(s), may rely upon the results of past planning studies to determine if the Generation Resource is necessary to support ERCOT System reliability.  The past planning studies must have used the same or more restrictive reliability criteria than the criteria described in paragraph (c) above.
(e)	Additionally, ERCOT shall conduct any other analysis (e.g., operations studies) as required and shall post all study data and results and all analyses and its determination on the MIS Secure Area and issue a Market Notice of its determination.
(4)	Within 30 days after receiving the NSO, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice indicating the status of the reliability analysis referenced in paragraph (3) above.  The Market Notice will indicate one of the following:
(a)	ERCOT has completed its reliability analysis and the Generation Resource is not required to support ERCOT System reliability;
(b)	ERCOT has completed its reliability analysis and the analysis identifies a performance deficiency for which the Generation Resource has a material impact; or
(c)	ERCOT has not completed its reliability analysis and will need additional time to complete the assessment. 
(5)	Within 60 days after receiving Part I and Part II of the NSO, ERCOT shall complete its reliability analysis described in paragraph (3) above and shall issue a Market Notice describing the results of its reliability analysis if the results were not provided in the Market Notice issued under paragraph (4) above.  If ERCOT determines that the Generation Resource is not needed to support ERCOT System reliability, then the Generation Resource may cease or suspend operations according to the schedule in its NSO, unless ERCOT in its sole discretion permits the Generation Resource to suspend operations at an earlier date, and ERCOT shall note this in the Market Notice.
(6)	Within ten days after a determination by ERCOT that the proposed suspension of the Generation Resource would result in a performance deficiency on which the Generation Resource has a material impact, as described in this Section, ERCOT shall issue a “Request for Proposal” (RFP) for Must-Run Alternatives (MRAs).  ERCOT shall include in the RFP reasonably available information that would enable potential MRAs to assess the feasibility of submitting a proposal to provide a more costeffective alternative to the Generation Resource, including any known minimum technical requirements and/or operational characteristics required to eliminate the identified performance deficiency.  The MRA RFP shall specify the expected number of hours that an MRA would be needed during the contract period, and the hours of the day, by season, that the MRA would be required to be available.  ERCOT shall establish an RFP response schedule such that responses can be evaluated prior to 150 days after submittal of the NSO.
(7)	Within ten days after a determination by ERCOT that the proposed suspension of the Generation Resource would result in a performance deficiency on which the Generation Resource has a material impact, as described in this Section, the Resource Entity shall, if it has not already done so, complete and submit to ERCOT Part III of the NSO (Section 22, Attachment E, Notification of Suspension of Operations).  ERCOT shall post the Part III information on the MIS Secure Area.  Concurrently, the Generation Resource shall submit an initial estimated budget used in the calculation of the proposed Standby Cost and RMR fuel adder, prepared in accordance with Section 3.14.1.11, Budgeting Eligible Costs, and Section 3.14.1.20, Budgeting Fuel Costs, to ERCOT.  On or before the 11th day after the determination or the receipt of Part III of the NSO, whichever comes first, ERCOT and the Resource Entity shall begin good faith negotiations on an RMR Agreement.  These negotiations shall include the budgeting process for Eligible Costs and for fuel costs as detailed in Section 3.14.1.11 and Section 3.14.1.20.
[NPRR1183:  Replace paragraph (7) above with the following upon system implementation:]

These negotiations shall include the budgeting process for Eligible Costs and for fuel costs as detailed in Section 3.14.1.11 and Section 3.14.1.20.
(8)	ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice on the status of the RMR Unit or MRA, including the start date, duration of the RMR or MRA Agreement, the Standby Cost ($/Hour) as applicable, and the amount of MW under contract, within 24 hours of signing an RMR or MRA Agreement with a Resource Entity.
(9)	Except in cases where the Generation Resource is to be mothballed on a seasonal basis, if, after 150 days following ERCOT’s receipt of Part I and Part II of the NSO, ERCOT has neither notified the Resource Entity that the continued operation of the Generation Resource is not required nor obtained ERCOT Board approval to enter into an RMR or MRA Agreement, then the Resource Entity may file a complaint with the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) under subsection (e)(1) of P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.502, Pricing Safeguards in Markets Operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.  If the Generation Resource is to be mothballed on a seasonal basis, then the Resource Entity may file such a complaint with the PUCT under subsection (e)(1) of P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.502 if ERCOT has neither notified the Resource Entity that the continued operation of the Generation Resource is not required nor obtained ERCOT Board approval to enter into an RMR Agreement within 90 days following ERCOT’s receipt of Part I and Part II of the NSO.
(10)	If the ERCOT Board approves entering into an RMR Agreement but ERCOT and the Resource Entity have not both executed the RMR Agreement by the date on which the Resource Entity intends to cease or suspend operation of the Generation Resource, then the Resource Entity shall maintain that Generation Resource(s) so that it is available for Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) commitment until no longer required to do so under subsection (e)(2) of P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.502.  This paragraph does not apply to a Generation Resource that suspended operations due to a Forced Outage.
3.14.1.2.1	ERCOT Evaluation of Seasonal Mothball Status
(1)	ERCOT shall evaluate requests to place Generation Resources on a seasonal mothball status pursuant to the guidelines provided in Section 3.14.1.2, ERCOT Evaluation Process, except as stated below.
(2)	Within 30 days after receiving the NSO described in Section 3.14.1.1, Notification of Suspension of Operations, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice indicating the status of the reliability analysis described in paragraph (3) of Section 3.14.1.2.  The Market Notice will indicate one of the following:  
(a)	ERCOT has completed its reliability analysis and the Generation Resource is not required to support ERCOT System reliability during the portion of the year when the Generation Resource would be unavailable;
(b)	ERCOT has completed its reliability analysis and the analysis identifies a performance deficiency for which the Generation Resource has a material impact during the portion of the year when the Generation Resource would be unavailable; or
(c)	ERCOT has not completed its reliability analysis and will need additional time to complete the assessment.   
(3)	Within 60 days after receiving the NSO ERCOT shall complete its reliability analysis described in paragraph (3) of Section 3.14.1.2 and, if it has not already done so, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice stating whether the Generation Resource is required to support ERCOT System reliability during the portion of the year when the Generation Resource would be unavailable.
3.14.1.3	ERCOT Board Approval of RMR and MRA Agreements
(1)	If ERCOT determines that an RMR or MRA Agreement is a cost-effective solution to remedy a performance deficiency for which the suspending Generation Resource has a material impact as described in paragraph (3) of Section 3.14.1.2, ERCOT Evaluation Process, or if ERCOT has identified such a performance deficiency but has determined that entering into an RMR or MRA Agreement is not a cost-effective solution to that performance deficiency, then ERCOT shall present this finding to the ERCOT Board for approval.  In seeking such approval, ERCOT shall stipulate to the ERCOT Board that:
(a)	The Resource Entity provided a complete and timely NSO including a sworn attestation supporting its claim of pending Generation Resource closure;
(b)	ERCOT received all of the data necessary to evaluate the need for and provisions of the RMR or MRA Agreement, and that information was posted on the MIS Secure Area by ERCOT as it became available to ERCOT;
(c)	When executed, the signed RMR or MRA Agreement will comply with the ERCOT Protocols and be posted on the MIS Secure Area;
(d)	ERCOT evaluated:
(i)	The reasonable alternatives to a specific RMR Agreement as set forth in Section 3.14.1, Reliability Must Run, and compared the alternatives against the feasibility, cost and reliability impacts of the signed RMR Agreement;
(ii)	The timeframe in which ERCOT expects each unit to be needed for reliability; and
(iii)	The specific type and scope of reliability concerns identified for each RMR Unit or MRA as applicable.
(2)	ERCOT shall execute the RMR or MRA Agreement as soon as feasible after receiving ERCOT Board approval to do so.
(3)	ERCOT shall post on the MIS Secure Area, as they become available, unit-specific studies, reports, and data, by which ERCOT justified entering into the RMR or MRA Agreement.
3.14.1.4	Exit Strategy from an RMR Agreement
(1)	No later than 90 days after the execution of an RMR Agreement, ERCOT shall report to the Board and post on the MIS Secure Area a list of feasible alternatives that may, at a future time, be more cost-effective than the continued renewal of the existing RMR Agreement.  Through the ERCOT System planning process, ERCOT shall develop a list of potential alternatives to the service provided by the RMR Unit.  At a minimum, the list of potential alternatives that ERCOT must consider include, building new or expanding existing Transmission Facilities, installing voltage control devices, soliciting or buying by auction interruptible Load from Retail Electric Providers (REPs), or extending the existing RMR Agreement on an annual basis.  If a cost-effective alternative to the service provided by the RMR Unit is identified, ERCOT shall provide a proposed timeline to study and/or implement the alternative.
3.14.1.5	Evaluation of Alternatives
(1)	In evaluating responses to the RFP for MRAs, ERCOT shall not consider any response that, in ERCOT’s sole opinion, does not facially demonstrate that the proposed MRA meets the eligibility requirements specified in Section 3.14.4.1, Overview and Description of MRAs, and the availability criteria and other conditions specified in the RFP for MRAs.
(2)	ERCOT shall consider any of the following options to resolve an identified performance deficiency:
(a)	The Generation Resource proposed for suspension of operations;
(b)	All acceptable MRA proposals; and
(c)	Any transmission upgrades that can be implemented prior to the time period for which the performance deficiency has been identified.
(3)	ERCOT staff shall select the option or combination of options, if any, that most cost-effectively address the performance deficiency, as long as the cost of the selected options is justified given the possible impact to Customers due to the performance deficiency.  If ERCOT determines that no option cost-effectively resolves the performance deficiency, then ERCOT shall not select any option.  In selecting the most cost-effective option, ERCOT will consider the following factors:
(a)	The degree to which the option addresses the identified performance deficiency;
(b)	The total expected cost of each option; 
(c)	Expected unit performance of the Generation Resource proposed for suspension of operations, including start-up time, minimum run-time, minimum down-time, and historical unit outage data;
(d)	Operational limitations of proposed MRAs, including start-up times, minimum run-times, ramp periods, and return-to-service times;
(e)	Other operational constraints or operational benefits of the proposed option; and
(f)	Any other factors which ERCOT determines are relevant to the evaluation, and for which ERCOT can develop quantifiable criteria with which to evaluate all proposed options. 
(4)	In evaluating the expected impact to Customers due to the performance deficiency, ERCOT shall consider the following factors:
      (a)	Expected amount of Customer Demand affected (MWh);
(b)	Expected number of hours during which Customers will be affected;
(c)	Number of Customers affected;
(d)	Possible additional Customer impacts due to unforeseen conditions, such as Generation Resource unavailability, transmission circuit Outages, or Load variation due to extreme weather; and
(e)	Potential economic impact to Customers.
(5)	ERCOT staff shall recommend the selected option or options to the ERCOT Board of Directors for approval, or shall recommend that the ERCOT Board of Directors decline to accept any option, if no eligible, cost-effective option has been identified.  ERCOT staff shall provide sufficient information to justify its recommendation.  The ERCOT Board of Directors may approve or reject the proposed recommendation, or may direct ERCOT staff to pursue an agreement to procure one or more options not proposed by ERCOT staff.
3.14.1.6	Transmission System Upgrades Associated with an RMR and/or MRA Exit Strategy
(1)	This Section applies only to RMR exit strategies corresponding to specific RMR or MRA Agreements that have not been terminated.
(a)	ERCOT and the TSP(s) responsible for constructing any upgrades to the Transmission Facilities that are part of an RMR or MRA exit strategy shall coordinate construction clearances necessary to allow timely completion of all planned Transmission Facilities upgrades.
(b)	The TSP(s) responsible for constructing upgrades to the Transmission Facilities that are part of an RMR or MRA exit strategy shall establish and send to ERCOT estimated Outage information, including completion dates and associated model information to ERCOT per Section 3.1.4, Communications Regarding Resource and Transmission Facilities Outages.  For purposes of this Section, a Transmission Facility upgrade will be considered initiated upon the TSP authorizing any expenditures on the upgrade including, but not limited to, material procurement, right-of-way acquisition, and regulatory approvals. 
(c)	Upon initiation of the project, the TSP(s) responsible for constructing upgrades relating to the Transmission Facilities that are part of an RMR or MRA exit strategy shall provide to ERCOT monthly updates of the project’s status, noting any acceleration or delay in planned completion date. ERCOT shall report this data through the MIS as described in Section 12.2, ERCOT Responsibilities. Within 60 days of the completion date shown in the Notice provided per Section 3.1.4, for the Transmission Facilities upgrades, the TSP shall coordinate more timely updates if the timeline changes significantly.  
(d)	Within ten Business Days after completion of the Transmission Facilities upgrades that are part of an RMR or MRA exit strategy, ERCOT shall publish a Market Notice of such completion and the effective date of termination of the associated RMR or MRA Agreement.
3.14.1.7	RMR or MRA Contract Termination
(1)	This Section applies only to RMR exit strategies corresponding to specific RMR or MRA Agreements that have not been terminated.
(2)	Once a suitable RMR or MRA exit strategy has been developed as defined in Section 3.14.1.4, Exit Strategy from an RMR Agreement, and the strategy has been approved by the ERCOT Board and the affected TSP(s), the TSP(s) responsible for the Transmission Facilities upgrades, when requested by ERCOT, shall submit to ERCOT:
(a)	A preliminary construction outage schedule necessary to complete the Transmission Facilities upgrades.  Submissions, changes, approvals, rejections, and withdrawals regarding the preliminary construction outage schedule shall be processed through the ERCOT Outage Scheduler on the ERCOT MIS.  Such construction outage schedule shall be updated monthly; or
(b)	A Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN) application timeline for projects requiring such PUCT certification.  Once a CCN has been granted by the PUCT, the TSP(s) shall be required to meet the requirements in item (a) above.
(3)	ERCOT shall review and approve or reject each construction outage schedule as provided in accordance with procedures developed by ERCOT in compliance with Section 3.1, Outage Coordination. 
(4)	The TSP(s) responsible for the Transmission Facilities upgrades that are part of an RMR or MRA exit strategy shall provide to ERCOT a project status and an estimated project completion date within five Business Days of ERCOT’s request. 
(5)	If ERCOT determines that a mutually agreeable preliminary construction outage schedule can be accommodated during the fall, winter, or spring, ERCOT and the TSP shall collaborate to determine if the 90 day termination notice for the RMR and/or MRA can be issued as soon after the summer load Season of the preceding year as possible and publish a Market Notice of these terminations.  ERCOT and the TSP may give consideration to the risk of the decision to terminate the RMR and/or MRA Agreement and any options, such as RAPs and/or Mitigation Plans that could be used to mitigate transmission construction delays.
3.14.1.8	RMR and/or MRA Contract Extension
(1)	This Section applies only to RMR exit strategies corresponding to specific RMR or MRA Agreements that have not been terminated.
(a)	Forty-five days prior to the termination date of an existing RMR or MRA Agreement, pursuant to the 90-day termination notice as described in paragraph A(2) of Section 3, Term and Termination, of Section 22, Attachment B, Standard Form Reliability Must-Run Agreement, ERCOT shall assess the likelihood of completion of the Transmission Facilities upgrade project(s) or other exit strategies necessary to allow termination of an existing RMR or MRA Agreement based on the updates of project status provided by the TSP(s).  If ERCOT determines that a delay in the termination date of the existing RMR or MRA Agreement is necessary to allow completion of the Transmission Facilities upgrade(s), it shall provide written Notice to the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA of its intent to execute an extension to the existing RMR or MRA Agreement no later than 30 days prior to the planned termination date.  Within 24 hours of ERCOT providing this Notice to the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice on its intent to execute an extension to the existing RMR or MRA Agreement.  The Market Notice must contain the name and seasonal MW ratings of the RMR Unit or MRA and the expected duration of the contract extension, including the expected termination date.  ERCOT shall notify the ERCOT Board of the extension at the ERCOT Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting.
(b)	Forty-five days prior to the expiration date of an existing RMR or MRA Agreement for which the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA has applied for renewal, ERCOT shall assess the likelihood of completion of the Transmission Facilities upgrade project(s) necessary to eliminate the reliability need for a Resource with an existing RMR or MRA Agreement based on the updates of project status provided by the TSP(s).  If ERCOT determines that an extension of the existing RMR or MRA Agreement of no more than 90 days would allow completion of the Transmission Facilities upgrade(s), it shall provide written Notice to the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA of its intent to execute an extension to the existing RMR or MRA Agreement no later than 30 days prior to the planned expiration date.  Within 24 hours of ERCOT providing this Notice to the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice on its intent to execute an extension to the existing RMR or MRA Agreement.  The Market Notice must contain the name and seasonal MW ratings of the RMR Unit or MRA and the expected duration of the contract extension, including the expected termination date.  ERCOT shall notify the ERCOT Board of the extension at the ERCOT Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting.
(c)	ERCOT may extend the existing RMR or MRA Agreement as necessary to allow completion of the Transmission Facilities upgrade(s), but in no event shall the extension last more than 90 days from the termination or expiration date of the existing RMR or MRA Agreement. 
(d)	Forty-five days prior to the end of the period for which the existing RMR or MRA Agreement has been extended, ERCOT shall assess whether the transmission upgrades are likely to be completed.  If ERCOT determines that the upgrades are not likely to be completed, ERCOT shall enter into negotiations with the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA to negotiate a new RMR or MRA Agreement to allow completion of the planned transmission upgrades.  ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice on or before the date that extension negotiations begin with the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA.  The Market Notice must contain the name and seasonal MW ratings of the RMR Unit or MRA and the expected duration of the contract extension, including the expected termination date.  Additionally, the Market Notice must contain a description of the exit strategy and the status of progress of exit strategy projects.  ERCOT shall notify the ERCOT Board of the extension at the ERCOT Board’s next regularly scheduled meeting.
3.14.1.9	Generation Resource Status Updates
(1)	By April 1st and October 1st of each year and when material changes occur, every Resource Entity that owns or controls a Mothballed Generation Resource or an RMR Unit shall report to ERCOT, on a unit-specific basis, the estimated lead time required for each Resource to be capable of returning to service and, in percentage terms, report probable generation capacity from each Resource that the Resource Entity expects to return to service in each Season of each of the next ten years.
(2)	For modeling purposes, ERCOT and TSPs shall rely on the most recent submittal of the following two Notifications with respect to an RMR Unit, Mothballed Generation Resource or Decommissioned Generation Resource: Section 22, Attachment E, Notification of Suspension of Operations, or Section 22, Attachment H, Notification of Change of Generation Resource Designation.  Except in the case of an NSO submitted for a Generation Resource temporarily suspending operation due to a Forced Outage, ERCOT shall post each submitted NSO and Notification of Change of Generation Resource Designation to the MIS Secure Area and issue a Market Notice notifying Market Participants of the posting as soon as practicable, but no later than five Business Days after receipt.
[NPRR1183:  Replace paragraph (2) above with the following upon system implementation:]
(2)	For modeling purposes, ERCOT and TSPs shall rely on the most recent submittal of the following two Notifications with respect to an RMR Unit, Mothballed Generation Resource or Decommissioned Generation Resource: Section 22, Attachment E, Notification of Suspension of Operations, or Section 22, Attachment H, Notification of Change of Generation Resource Designation.  Except in the case of an NSO submitted for a Generation Resource temporarily suspending operation due to a Forced Outage, ERCOT shall post each submitted NSO and Notification of Change of Generation Resource Designation to the ERCOT website and issue a Market Notice notifying Market Participants of the posting as soon as practicable, but no later than five Business Days after receipt.
(3)	A Mothballed Generation Resource that is not mothballed indefinitely shall remain modeled in all ERCOT systems at all times, (i.e., will not be flagged as “mothballed” in ERCOT’s models) and, when it is not available, the Resource Entity shall designate the Generation Resource as on Planned Outage in the Outage Scheduler.
(4)	Except for Mothballed Generation Resources that operate under a Seasonal Operation Period, a Resource Entity with a Mothballed Generation Resource shall notify ERCOT in writing no less than 30 days prior to the date on which the Resource Entity intends to return a Mothballed Generation Resource to service by completing a Notification of Change of Generation Resource Designation.  
(5)	A Resource Entity must submit a Notification of Change of Generation Resource Designation no later than 60 days prior to the conclusion of an RMR Agreement.
(6)	A Resource Entity with a Mothballed Generation Resource that operates under a Seasonal Operation Period shall notify ERCOT in writing no less than 15 days prior to the date on which the Resource Entity intends to begin its Seasonal Operation Period if the first date of operation is prior to the date designated by the Resource Entity in its NSO.  A Resource Entity with a Mothballed Generation Resource that operates under a Seasonal Operation Period shall notify ERCOT in writing no less than 15 days prior to the end date designated by the Resource Entity in its NSO if the Resource Entity intends to suspend operation later than that date.  Notifications under this Section shall be provided by the Resource Entity by completing a Notification of Change of Generation Resource Designation form (Section 22, Attachment H).
(7)	Once the Resource Entity notifies ERCOT that a Mothballed Generation Resource is operating under a Seasonal Operation Period, the Resource Entity does not need to annually notify ERCOT of such status.
(8)	A Resource Entity with a Mothballed Generation Resource operating under a Seasonal Operation Period shall notify ERCOT in writing no less than 15 days prior to the date on which the Resource Entity intends to return the Mothballed Generation Resource to year-round operation by completing a Notification of Change of Generation Resource Designation form (Section 22, Attachment H).  
(9)	A Resource Entity with a Mothballed Generation Resource that is not currently mothballed indefinitely must notify ERCOT in writing, by completing an NSO (Section 22, Attachment E), no less than 150 days before the date on which the Mothballed Generation Resource is to be suspended indefinitely or retired and decommissioned.
(10)	ERCOT may request that a Mothballed Generation Resource operating under a Seasonal Operation Period be available for operation earlier than June 1st or later than September 30th of any given calendar year.  If ERCOT identifies a specific Resource Entity or QSE with which it will discuss such a request in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable resolution, ERCOT shall issue a Notice as soon as practicable.  The Notice shall include the Resource name and, as applicable, the Resource mnemonic, the Resource MW rating by Season, and the potential duration of the extended operation period, including anticipated start and end dates.  If agreement is reached for the Mothballed Generation Resource to be available for operation earlier than June 1st or later than September 30th, the Resource Entity shall complete, within two Business Days, a Notification of Change of Generation Resource Designation form (Section 22, Attachment H).
(11)	If ERCOT and the Resource Entity or QSE cannot reach a mutual agreement to make the Mothballed Generation Resource operating under a Seasonal Operation Period available earlier than June 1st or later than September 30th of any given calendar year, then ERCOT may exercise its ability to bring the Mothballed Generation Resource operating under a Seasonal Operating Period into the market under an RMR Agreement pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 6.5.1.1, ERCOT Control Area Authority.
(12)	ERCOT may evaluate, on an annual basis, Mothballed Generation Resources operating under a Seasonal Operation Period for RMR Service to address ERCOT System reliability during the portion of the year when the Mothballed Generation Resource would be unavailable. 
(13)	A Resource Entity that submitted an NSO as a result of a Forced Outage must notify ERCOT of its intent to return to service as soon as practicable by updating its status in the Outage Scheduler and Current Operating Plan (COP) and is not required to submit a Notification of Change of Generation Resource Designation.
(14)	Before retiring and decommissioning either a Mothballed Generation Resource this is mothballed indefinitely or an RMR Unit that would otherwise become a Mothballed Generation Resource upon expiration of an RMR Agreement, a Resource Entity shall notify ERCOT of the expected retirement by submitting a completed Notification of Change of Generation Resource Designation form (Section 22, Attachment H).  The date of retirement indicated on the form shall comply with the requirements of Section 3.10.1, Time Line for Network Operations Model Changes.      
(15)	If a Generation Resource is designated as decommissioned and retired pursuant to any of the above provisions, ERCOT will permanently remove the Generation Resource from the ERCOT registration systems in accordance with Section 3.10.1.  Except as provided in paragraph (16) below, if a Resource Entity decides to bring a Decommissioned Generation Resource back to service at a later date, it will be considered a new Resource and must follow the Generator Interconnection or Modification (GIM) process detailed in the Planning Guide.  If the Generation Resource is designated as mothballed, ERCOT and TSPs will consider the Generation Resource mothballed until the Resource Entity indicates a definitive return to service date pursuant to this Section.
(16)	A Resource Entity may bring a Decommissioned Generation Resource back to service without following the GIM process if the operating characteristics of the Resource are materially identical to the characteristics of the Resource as it existed prior to the date of decommissioning and the Resource Entity submits a Notification of Change of Generation Resource Designation (Section 22, Attachment H) within three years of the date the Generation Resource was removed from the ERCOT Network Operations Model.  The date of return proposed in the Notification must be a Network Operations Model load date that is no earlier than 45 days and no later than 180 days from the date of the Resource Entity’s Notification.  ERCOT may delay the Network Operations Model load date based on the timing of the Resource Entity’s submission of complete Resource registration data.  If the Resource Entity is not the Resource Entity that was associated with the Generation Resource at the time it was removed from the model, the Resource Entity shall provide ERCOT documentation that establishes the Resource Entity’s ownership of the Generation Resource.  
(a)	Notwithstanding the proposed date of return reflected in the Notification, as a condition for the synchronization of the Resource, ERCOT or the interconnecting Transmission and/or Distribution Service Provider (TDSP) may require any studies, testing, metering, or facility upgrades that ERCOT or the TDSP deem necessary for the reliable interconnection of the Resource, and ERCOT may require the Resource Entity to resolve any operational concern associated with the Resource.  The TDSP may require the Resource Entity to compensate the TDSP for any required studies or upgrades in the same manner contemplated for new Generation Resources by the ERCOT Planning Guide, the TDSP’s tariff, and the Standard Generation Interconnection Agreement (SGIA).  
(b)	If ERCOT or the TDSP requires any studies, testing, metering or facility upgrades, or if ERCOT determines that operational concerns must be addressed, the Resource Entity must complete the commissioning process within 90 days of the date of synchronization, subject to any extension authorized by ERCOT for good cause.  
(c)	Any Generation Resource that returns to service pursuant to this paragraph is entitled to any exemption from ERCOT requirements that the Resource was entitled to at the time it was removed from the model if the exemption still exists under ERCOT rules.
3.14.1.10	Eligible Costs

3.14.1.11	Budgeting Eligible Costs
(1)	The owner of an RMR Unit shall provide a good faith preliminary budget, including detailed monthly estimates of its Eligible Costs to ERCOT, to support its calculation of the initial Standby Cost in Part III of the Notification of Suspension of Operations submitted to ERCOT pursuant to paragraph (4) of Section 3.14.1.2, ERCOT Evaluation Process, in a format acceptable to ERCOT.  ERCOT shall review the budget and may reject any item it determines to be unreasonable.  The owner of the RMR Unit and ERCOT may mutually agree to modify the expected contract capacity and Target Availability of the RMR Unit as necessary to account for any budget item that is rejected.
(2)	As part of the MRA evaluation process, the QSE that represents the MRA must notify ERCOT if any contributed capital expenditures are required under the proposed MRA Agreement.  The QSE that represents the MRA shall provide an explanation and a good faith preliminary budget for the contributed capital expenditures in a format acceptable to ERCOT.  ERCOT shall review and may approve the budget to determine which costs would be considered contributed capital expenditures in accordance with Section 3.14.1.19, Charge for Contributed Capital Expenditures.
(3)	ERCOT may retain a third party mutually agreeable to ERCOT and the owner of the RMR Unit to assist in the evaluation of a submitted budget, whether for initial or updated costs.  The cost of such a third party will be allocated pursuant to paragraph (2) of Section 6.6.6.6, Method for Reconciling RMR Actual Eligible Costs, RMR and MRA Contributed Capital Expenditures, and Miscellaneous RMR Incurred Expenses. 
(4)	The Eligible Cost budgeting process is as follows:
(a)	The RMR Unit owner shall supply ERCOT a preliminary Eligible Cost budget for the expected RMR Agreement period starting with the anticipated effective date of the RMR Agreement.  
(b)	The preliminary Eligible Cost budget should be submitted in conjunction with Part III of the NSO, as specified in paragraph (2) of Section 3.14.1.1, Notification of Suspension of Operations, and paragraph (6) of Section 3.14.1.2.  
(c)	The budget will include Eligible Costs categorized in terms of:

(ii)	Outage Maintenance Cost, which includes Eligible Costs attributable to Planned or Maintenance Outages and/or inspections occurring during the term of the RMR Agreement, by month.  Maintenance alternatives available during any Planned or Maintenance Outage must be presented to ERCOT for determination of the alternative to be performed and paid for under the RMR Agreement.  The RMR Unit owner must present ERCOT with a budget for each option, benefits of each alternative, unit availability impact associated with not performing each alternative, and a recommendation to facilitate ERCOT’s selection process.  If no reasonable alternatives are available then the RMR Unit owner shall provide an affirmation to that effect; 
(iii)	Non-Outage Maintenance Cost, by month, which includes non-recurring Eligible Costs that are independent of a particular scheduled Outage.  Non-Outage maintenance alternatives available during any scheduled Outage must be presented to ERCOT for determination of the alternative to be performed and paid for under the RMR Agreement.  The RMR Unit owner must present ERCOT with a budget for each option, benefits of each alternative, unit availability impact associated with not performing each alternative, and a recommendation to facilitate ERCOT’s selection process.  If no reasonable alternatives are available then an affirmation by the RMR Unit owner to that effect must be included in the RMR Agreement; 
(iv)	For Resources without approved verifiable costs, the following data is required:
(A)	Variable Operations & Maintenance (O&M) costs ($/start), from start to Low Sustained Limit (LSL), for each start type:
(1)	Cold; 
(2)	Hot; and
(3)	Intermediate;
(B)	Operating variable O&M costs ($/MWh):
(1)	At LSL; and
(2)	Above LSL;
(C)	Average generation from breaker close to LSL (MWh), for each start type:
(1)	Cold; 
(2)	Hot; and
(3)	Intermediate;
(D)	Fuel consumption (MMBtu/start), for each start type:
(1)	Cold;

Above LSL
Gas


Fuel Oil


Solid Fuel


(G)	Input/output curve coefficients; 
(v)	Other budget items means Eligible Costs not clearly identifiable in the previous three categories including:
(A)	Environmental emission credit consumption (or purchase as explicitly defined under the RMR Agreement, to operate the unit) includes the opportunity cost for using emission credits through the combustion of fuel feedstock by the RMR Unit.  Costs must be based on verifiable market data as supplied by the RMR Unit owner; and 
(B)	“Compliance Costs,” which includes foreseeable costs to comply with regulations, Federal or state that have a compliance deadline that occurs during the term of the RMR Agreement.
(d)	Thirty days after receipt of the preliminary Eligible Costs budget, ERCOT shall notify the RMR Unit owner of its selections under the alternatives provided in the preliminary budget.  The RMR Unit owner and ERCOT shall set the Target Availability monthly values consistent with the options presented to and selected by during the budgeting process.  The Target Availability shall be mutually agreed by ERCOT and the RMR Unit owner by taking into account a negotiated amount of predicted Forced Outages, Planned Outages identified during the budgeting process, and any budget items rejected by ERCOT.
(e)	If applicable, the RMR Unit owner should provide a written description of the type of work needed for the Resource to achieve the operational conditions for the RMR Service, in accordance with the capacity and Target Availability requirements.  This should include:
(i)	A description of the equipment needed;
(ii)	An indication if the equipment is anticipated to be expensed or capitalized;
(iii)	The estimated life and depreciation schedule of each capitalized component;
(iv)	The estimated salvage value of the capitalized components;  
(v)	The estimated time to install each piece of equipment; and
(vi)	The expected time of completion of work needed to restore the Resource to operational status.
3.14.1.12	Calculation of the Initial Standby Cost 
(1)	The initial Standby Cost shall be calculated by dividing the total monthly approved budget cost over the term of the RMR Agreement by the total hours for the term of the RMR Agreement.
3.14.1.13	Updated Budgets During the Term of an RMR Agreement
(1)	Upon commencement of the RMR Agreement, based on the Agreement term, the RMR Unit owner shall identify planned equipment installations as anticipated to be expensed or capitalized and shall update the estimated salvage value of capitalized components.  The RMR Unit owner shall submit to ERCOT updated budget information every three months, in a format consistent with the preliminary budget, for the remainder of the term of the RMR Agreement.  ERCOT shall review updated budget information for reasonableness and may reject any item it determines to be unreasonable.  The owner of the RMR Unit and ERCOT may mutually agree to modify the contract capacity and Target Availability of the RMR Unit to account for any such budget item rejection.  
(2)	ERCOT will use approved updated budget information to update the total RMR costs expected to be incurred over the remaining term of the RMR Agreement.  If the total costs over the remaining term of the RMR Agreement change by more than 10% with respect to those costs anticipated for the same period in the most recently approved budget, the RMR Standby Cost will be recalculated.  The revised Standby Cost will be recalculated by dividing the remaining budgeted costs over the number of remaining hours for which the RMR Unit is under an RMR Agreement.
(3)	ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice describing the revised Standby Cost at least ten calendar days prior to the effective date of a change to the Standby Cost.  The effective date of a revised Standby Cost will always be on the first day of a calendar month.
3.14.1.14	Reporting Actual RMR Eligible Costs 
(1) 	The RMR Unit owner shall provide ERCOT with documentation supporting actual Eligible Costs on a monthly basis in a form and a level of detail acceptable to ERCOT for ERCOT to verify that all Eligible Costs are actual and appropriate.  Submitted actual Eligible Costs must be categorized consistently with budgeted Eligible Costs.  Actual cost data must be submitted on time by the Resource Entity for the RMR Unit and then verified by ERCOT so the actual cost data can be reflected in the Final or True-Up Settlement Statement. 
(2) 	To be considered timely for the final, actual cost data for month ‘x’ must be submitted by the 16th of the month following month ‘x’.  To be considered timely for the true-up, actual cost data for month ‘x’ must be submitted 60 days prior to the publishing date of the True-Up Settlement Statement for the first day in month ‘x’.  Any deviation in filing actual cost data in accordance with this calendar must be requested of ERCOT, by the QSE representing an RMR Unit.  Such request for deviation shall contain the reason for the inability to meet the calendar and an expected date that the cost data will be provided to ERCOT.  At its discretion ERCOT may choose to honor such a request.  No later than two Business Days following its decision, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice of any such request and its response thereto.  In the event, that actual cost data is not submitted  in accordance with the calendar or approved deviation for the true-up, then the cost for the portion of eligible cost that has not been submitted is deemed to be zero. 
3.14.1.15	Reporting Actual MRA Eligible Costs 
(1)	The QSE that represents the MRA that has received contributed capital expenditures shall provide ERCOT with evidence of the actual costs associated with the capital expenditures on a monthly basis in a level of detail sufficient for ERCOT to verify that all capital contributions costs are actual and appropriate.
3.14.1.16	Reconciliation of Actual Eligible Costs
(1)	ERCOT shall issue a miscellaneous Invoice to charge the QSE representing the RMR Unit for any identified over-payments for actual Eligible Costs.  Funds collected will be distributed in accordance with Section 6.6.6.6, Method for Reconciling RMR Actual Eligible Costs, RMR and MRA Contributed Capital Expenditures, and Miscellaneous RMR Incurred Expenses.
3.14.1.17	Incentive Factor
(1)	Subject to the reductions described in paragraphs (2) and (3) below, the Incentive Factor for RMR Agreements is equal to 10% of the actual Eligible Costs, excluding fuel costs and reservation and transportation costs associated with firm fuel supplies as described in paragraph (1)(a)(vi) of Section 3.14.1.10, Eligible Costs.  The Incentive Factor for RMR Agreements is not applied to capital expenditures as described in Section 3.14.1, Reliability Must Run, or to capital expenditures reclassified as an expense in accordance with paragraph (3)(d) of Section 3.14.1.19, Charge for Contributed Capital Expenditures.  The Incentive Factor shall never be less than zero.
(2)	The Incentive Factor shall be reduced if the RMR Unit fails to perform to the contracted capacity during a Capacity Test as described in the RMR Agreement.  The reduction will be linear, with a 2% reduction in the Incentive Factor for every 1% of reduced Capacity.
(3)	The Incentive Factor shall be reduced if the “Hourly Rolling Equivalent Availability Factor” of the RMR Unit is less than the Target Availability (i.e. the “Actual Availability”, as defined below, is less than the Target Availability).  
(a)	The reduction will be linear; with a 2% reduction in the Incentive Factor payment for every 1% of the Hourly Rolling Equivalent Availability Factor less than the Target Availability stated in the RMR Agreement.  The RMR Unit’s Actual Availability shall be calculated on an hourly rolling six-month average basis. 
(b)	The calculation is made by dividing the total MW of available capacity per hour according to its final COP by the total MW of contracted capacity per hour for the previous 4380 hours.
(c)	For purposes of this calculation, any hour within the previous 4380-hour period that precedes the start date of the RMR Agreement is treated as if 100% of the capacity of the unit was available for the hour.
3.14.1.18	Major Equipment Modifications
(1)	During the term of an RMR Agreement, in the event that major equipment modifications are required in order for the RMR Unit to provide RMR Service (such as installation of environmental control equipment), ERCOT and the RMR Unit owner shall negotiate in good faith concerning changes to the terms of the RMR Agreement.
3.14.1.19	Charge for Contributed Capital Expenditures
(1)	This Section applies to any RMR or MRA Agreement entered into by ERCOT and a Resource Entity or QSE on or after October 12, 2016.  
(2) 	For purposes of this Section, contributed capital expenditures are defined as expenditures that were made to ensure the availability of an RMR Unit or MRA in connection with an RMR or MRA Agreement, that were settled in accordance with the Settlement processes in the ERCOT Protocols, and that would ordinarily be capitalized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Accounting Standards (IAS) assuming ongoing operation of the RMR Unit or MRA.  Consistent with the process described in Section 3.14.1.11, Budgeting Eligible Costs, ERCOT will identify contributed capital expenditure items included in each category of submitted Eligible Costs as defined in Section 3.14.1.10, Eligible Costs, or submitted with any MRA budgets.  
(3)	A QSE that has received payments from ERCOT for contributed capital expenditures pursuant to an RMR or MRA Agreement entered into on or after October 12, 2016 must refund to ERCOT the contributed capital expenditures as follows:
(a)	At the end of the RMR Agreement, if the Resource Entity chooses not to have the Generation Resource participate in energy or Ancillary Service markets, the QSE representing the Resource Entity shall repay, in a lump sum payment, the positive salvage value associated with the contributed capital expenditures, as estimated at the time of the RMR Agreement.
(b) 	At the end of the MRA Agreement, if the QSE that represents the MRA chooses not to have the MRA participate in energy or Ancillary Service markets, the QSE representing the MRA shall repay, in a lump sum payment, the positive salvage value associated with the contributed capital expenditures, as estimated at the time of the MRA Agreement.  In addition, the QSE that represents the MRA must repay, in a lump sum payment, the value of contributed capital expenditures in excess of the actual cost of the capitalized equipment.
(c)	If an RMR Unit or MRA participates in the energy or Ancillary Service markets at any time after the termination date of the RMR or MRA Agreement, the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA shall repay, in a lump sum payment, 100% of the remaining book value of the capitalized equipment and capitalized installation charges based on straight-line depreciation over the estimated life of the capitalized component(s) as of the termination date of the RMR or MRA Agreement in accordance with GAAP or IAS standards for electric utility equipment, plus 10% of the value of any accelerated tax depreciation associated with the capital contribution taken by the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA during the term of the RMR or MRA Agreement, less any remaining positive salvage value associated with the contributed capital expenditures that was previously repaid in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b) above.  The estimated life shall be based on documentation provided by the manufacturer; or, if installing used equipment, the estimated life may be based on an approximation agreed to by the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA and ERCOT, but in no event shall the estimated life be less than the equipment life used for federal income tax purposes.  The value of the accelerated tax depreciation for each year shall be the difference between the straight line figure and the appropriate Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) depreciation schedule for the equipment, multiplied by the statutory tax rate.  The calculation of the accelerated depreciation as described herein must be supported by an attestation executed by an officer or executive with the authority to bind the Resource Entity or the QSE representing the Resource Entity.    
(d)	If additional contributed capital expenditures are identified subsequent to execution and during the term of the RMR or MRA Agreement, the applicable repayment amounts as determined in paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) above will be modified accordingly.
(e)	The amount of contributed capital expenditures may be adjusted by ERCOT when early termination in accordance with the RMR Agreement results in a reclassification of capital expenditures to expenses in accordance with GAAP or IAS.
(f)	If the Resource Entity that owns or controls the RMR Unit or the QSE that represents the MRA is required to pay a lump sum payment of contributed capital expenditures per paragraph (a), (b), or (c) above, then ERCOT will issue a Market Notice identifying the amount of the lump sum payment within five Business Days of termination of the RMR or MRA Agreement.  
(i)	ERCOT shall issue a miscellaneous Invoice charging the QSE for the applicable amounts under paragraphs (a), (b), or (c) above.  ERCOT will issue a Market Notice after completion of the collection and disbursement of the repaid contributed capital expenditures.
(ii)	ERCOT shall distribute the repayment to QSEs representing Load per Section 6.6.6.6, Method for Reconciling RMR Actual Eligible Costs, RMR and MRA Contributed Capital Expenditures, and Miscellaneous RMR Incurred Expenses.
3.14.1.20	Budgeting Fuel Costs
(1)	The RMR Unit owner shall supply ERCOT a preliminary monthly fuel cost budget for the anticipated term and effective date of the RMR Agreement.  The fuel cost budget must include information pertaining to the cost of the fuel feedstock, including where appropriate transportation costs and terms, as well as fuel storage costs and terms, and any other fuel contract provisions (e.g. “take or pay” provisions) that may impact the cost of all fuels anticipated to be used by the RMR Unit over the life of the RMR Agreement and must include fuel costs categorized in terms of: 
(a)	Primary fuel; and 
(b)	Secondary fuel.
(2)	The estimated fuel payments may include a fuel adder to better approximate expected fuel costs, which may be adjusted from time to time by mutual agreement of the RMR Unit owner and ERCOT.  The fuel adder shall represent the difference between the forecasted average fuel price and the forecasted average of the relevant index price over the RMR contract period.  The fuel adder must also include the forecasted cost of transporting and delivering fuel and fuel imbalance fees to the Resource.  The RMR Unit owner must provide to ERCOT supporting documentation indicating how the fuel adder was determined.
(3)	The RMR Unit owner shall provide good faith estimates of the RMR Unit input/output curve coefficients to ERCOT with its Notification of Suspension of Operations.  
(4)	Based on production figures provided to the RMR Unit owner by ERCOT, the RMR Unit owner shall also provide ERCOT fuel supply options available for the RMR Unit.  For each option, the RMR Unit owner shall detail the associated impacts on the fuel and non-fuel budgets and on the availability of the RMR Unit.  If no reasonable alternatives are available then an affirmation by the RMR Unit owner to that effect must be included in the RMR Agreement.  If there are available fuel options, then no less than 30 days after the receipt of the fuel supply options, ERCOT shall notify the RMR Unit owner of its fuel supply option selection.
3.14.1.21	Reporting Actual Eligible Fuel Costs
(1)	The RMR Unit owner shall provide ERCOT with actual fuel costs on a monthly basis for the RMR Unit in a level of detail sufficient for ERCOT to verify that all fuel costs are actual and appropriate.  ERCOT shall perform a true-up of the estimated fuel costs using the submitted and verified actual fuel costs for the RMR Unit.  Actual cost data must be submitted on time by the Resource Entity for the RMR Unit and then verified by ERCOT so the actual cost data can be reflected in the True-Up Settlement Statement.  To be considered timely for the final, actual cost data for month ‘x’ must be submitted by the 16th of the month following month ‘x.’  To be considered timely for the true-up, actual cost data for month ‘x’ must be submitted 60 days prior to the publishing date of the True-Up Settlement Statement for the first day in month ‘x.’  Any deviation in filing actual cost data in accordance with this calendar must be requested of ERCOT, by the QSE representing an RMR Unit.  Such request for deviation shall contain the reason for the inability to meet the calendar and an expected date that the cost data will be provided to ERCOT.  At its discretion ERCOT may choose to honor such a request.  No later than two Business Days following its decision, ERCOT shall issue a Market Notice of any such request and its response thereto.  In the event that actual cost data is not submitted in accordance with the timeline or is not an approved deviation for the true-up, then the cost for the portion of Eligible Cost that has not been submitted is deemed to be zero.
(2)	Actual fuel costs must be appropriate actual costs attributable to ERCOT’s scheduling and/or deployment of the RMR Unit.  Actual fuel costs may include cost of fuel (including the cost of exceeding swing gas contract limits, additional gas demand costs set by fuel supply, or transportation contracts); demand fees, imbalance penalties, transportation charges, and cash out premiums. In addition, actual fuel costs may include costs incurred to:
(a)	Keep the boiler(s) warmed, if approved in advance by ERCOT; and 
(b)	Test the RMR Unit prior to or during the term of the RMR Agreement, if approved in advance by ERCOT.

Bids must be evaluated based on evaluation criteria attached as an appendix to the request for bids and contracted by December 31st for the following three-year period.  ERCOT shall ensure BSSs are arranged, provided, and deployed as necessary to reenergize the ERCOT System following a Blackout or Partial Blackout.
(a)	Resources shall disclose any weather-related limitations that could affect the Resource’s ability to provide BSS using the form provided in Section 22, Attachment M, Generation Resource Disclosure Regarding Bids for Black Start Service, as part of a bid to provide BSS. 
(b)	BSS bids shall include the hourly stand-by price and the BSS Back-up Fuel costs where applicable.
(c)	When a Resource is selected to provide BSS, the Black Start Resource shall be required to complete all applicable testing requirements as specified in Section 8.1.1.2.1.5, System Black Start Capability Qualification and Testing.
(d)	ERCOT shall provide a list of all prospective Black Start Resources that responded to the RFP for BSS to the impacted TSPs no later than seven days after the date on which bids for BSS are due.  Any feedback from affected TSPs shall be limited to the identification of transmission constraints that may adversely impact the ability of the Black Start Resource to energize the “Next Start Resource” and shall be due to ERCOT by March 1st of that year.  ERCOT shall share the feedback with the QSE representing the prospective Black Start Resource as soon as practicable.  The QSE representing the Black Start Resource shall have the option to provide a response to any feedback provided by an affected TSP.
(4)	ERCOT may schedule unannounced Black Start testing, to verify that BSS is operable as specified in Section 8.1.1.2.1.5.
(5)	QSEs representing Generation Resources contracting for BSSs shall participate in training and restoration drills coordinated by ERCOT.
(6)	ERCOT shall periodically determine and review the location and number of Black Start Resources required, as well as any special transmission or voice communication needs required.  ERCOT and providers of this service shall meet the requirements as specified in the Operating Guides and in NERC Reliability Standards.
(7)	A Resource Entity representing a Black Start Resource may request that an alternate Generation Resource which is connected to the same black start primary and secondary cranking path as the original Black Start Resource be substituted in place of the original Black Start Resource during the three-year term of an executed Standard Form Black Start Agreement (Section 22, Attachment D, Standard Form Black Start Agreement) if the alternate Generation Resource meets testing and verification under established qualification criteria to ensure BSS.
(a)	ERCOT, in its sole discretion, may reject a Resource Entity’s request for an alternate Generation Resource and will provide the Resource Entity an explanation of such rejection.  
(b)	If ERCOT accepts the alternative Generation Resource as the substituted Black Start Resource, such acceptance shall not affect the original terms, conditions and obligations of the Resource Entity under the Standard Form Black Start Agreement.  The Resource Entity shall submit to ERCOT an Amendment to Standard Form Black Start Agreement (Section 22, Attachment I, Amendment to Standard Form Black Start Agreement) after qualification criteria has been met.
(8)	For the purpose of the Black Start Hourly Standby Fee as described in Section 6.6.8.1, Black Start Hourly Standby Fee Payment, the BSS Availability Reduction Factor shall be determined by using the availability for the original Black Start Resource and any substituted Black Start Resource(s), as appropriate for the rolling 4380-hour period of the evaluation.
(9)	Each Generation Resource selected to provide BSS shall be prepared and able to provide BSS at any time as may be required by ERCOT, subject only to the limitations described in ERCOT Protocols or the Black Start Agreement.  
(10)	Each Generation Resource selected to provide BSS shall be able to utilize BSS Back-up Fuel for BSS and shall maintain a contracted amount of BSS Back-up Fuel to run the Black Start Resource for a minimum of 72 hours at its maximum output.  The Generation Resource shall maintain the contracted amount of BSS Back-up Fuel at all times during the duration of the BSS contract term unless performing a BSS Back-up Fuel Switching Test or the Generation Resource is operating pursuant to a Black Start deployment event.  This requirement does not apply to Resources that do not rely on purchased fuel.  
(11)	A Black Start Resource may utilize the contracted amount of BSS Back-up Fuel outside of BSS if ERCOT determines it is necessary during an Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) event.
(12)	A Black Start Resource is not obligated to contract its full on site fuel storage capability for BSS Back-up Fuel.  On site backup fuel in excess of the contracted BSS Back-up Fuel amount may be used by the Generation Resource at the discretion of the Generation Resource and ERCOT shall not prevent the Black Start Resource from utilizing the excess fuel, nor shall the Black Start Resource be required to request permission from ERCOT to utilize fuel in excess of the contracted BSS Back-up Fuel amount.  
(13)	ERCOT may, at its discretion, waive the BSS Back-up Fuel requirement stated in this Section, in whole or in part, if ERCOT deems necessary in order to procure a sufficient number or preferred combination of Generation Resources to provide BSS.
(14)	A Resource Entity that submits a bid or is contracted to provide BSS or serve as an alternate to provide BSS with a Switchable Generation Resource (SWGR): 
(a)	Shall not nominate the SWGR to satisfy supply adequacy or capacity planning requirements in any Control Area other than the ERCOT Region during the term of the BSS contract; 
(b)	Shall submit a report to ERCOT in compliance with paragraph (2) of Section 16.5.4, Maintaining and Updating Resource Entity Information, indicating that the SWGR does not have any contractual requirement in a non-ERCOT Control Area during the term of the BSS contract; and 
(c)	Shall take any further action requested by ERCOT to ensure that ERCOT will be classified as the “Primary Party” for the SWGR under any agreement between ERCOT and another Control Area Operator (CAO) during the term of the BSS contract.    
(15)	If a Resource Entity with a SWGR is contracted to provide BSS or designated as an alternate to provide BSS, the Resource Entity shall have its Black Start plan procedures approved by ERCOT.  In the event of a Partial Blackout or Blackout of the ERCOT System, the Resource Entity with a SWGR shall immediately: 
(a)	Effectuate its Black Start plan procedures to be available to provide BSS; and  
(b)	Provide BSS as directed by ERCOT or the local Transmission Operator (TO).
(16)	Each Resource Entity shall identify in its Resources Registration data if its Resource is a Black Start Capable Resource and an Isochronous Control Capable Resource.
(17)	Each Resource Entity and each TSP shall identify in the Network Operations Model if a modeled breaker or switch it operates or directs the operation of has a Synchroscope and a Synchronism Check Relay associated with the breaker or switch.
3.14.3	Emergency Response Service
(1)	ERCOT shall procure and deploy ERS with the goal of promoting reliability prior to and during energy emergencies.
3.14.3.1	Emergency Response Service Procurement
(1)	ERCOT shall issue Requests for Proposals to procure ERS for each Standard Contract Term.  The ERS Standard Contract Terms are as follows:
(a)	December through March;
(b)	April and May;
(c)	June through September; and
(d) 	October and November.
(2)	ERCOT shall procure ERS from one or more of the four following ERS service types:
      (a)	Weather-Sensitive ERS-10
(b)	Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS-10
(c)	Weather-Sensitive ERS-30
(d)	Non-Weather-Sensitive ERS-30
(3)	ERS offers shall be submitted only by QSEs capable of receiving both Extensible Markup Language (XML) messaging and Verbal Dispatch Instructions (VDIs) on behalf of represented ERS Resources.   
(4)	Each site in an ERS Generator must have an interconnection agreement with its TDSP prior to submitting an ERS offer and must have exported energy to the ERCOT System prior to the offer due date.  An ERS Resource that cannot inject energy to the ERCOT System can only be offered as an ERS Load.
(5)	In order to qualify as weather-sensitive, an ERS Load must meet one of the following criteria:
(a)	The ERS Load must consist exclusively of residential sites; or 
(b)	The ERS Load must consist exclusively of non-residential sites and must qualify as weather-sensitive based on the accuracy of the regression baseline evaluation methodology as described in Section 8.1.3.1.1, Baselines for Emergency Response Service Loads, as an indicator of actual interval Load.
(i)	ERCOT shall establish minimum accuracy standards for qualification as an ERS Load under the regression baseline evaluation methodology.  
(ii)	An ERS Load must have at least nine months of interval meter data to qualify as weather-sensitive under the regression baseline evaluation methodology.
(iii)	ERCOT’s determination that an ERS Load qualifies as a weather-sensitive ERS Load is independent of ERCOT’s determination of which baseline methodologies may be appropriate for purposes of evaluating the ERS Load’s performance.
(c)	If a site with Distributed Renewable Generation (DRG) has been designated by the QSE to be evaluated by using its native load, the default baseline analysis shall be performed using the calculated native load.
(6)	QSEs representing ERS Resources may submit offers for one or more ERS Time Periods within an ERS Standard Contract Term.  ERS Time Periods shall be defined by ERCOT in the RFP for that ERS Standard Contract Term.  An ERS offer is specific to an ERS Time Period.  In submitting an offer, both the QSE and the ERS Resource are committing to provide ERS for that ERS Time Period if selected.
(7)	A QSE may submit separate offers for an ERS Resource to provide any or all of the four ERS service types during the same or different ERS Time Periods in the same ERS Standard Contract Term, but ERCOT shall only award offers for one service type for each ERS Resource.
(8)	The minimum capacity offer for an ERS Load on the weather-sensitive baseline is one half (0.5) MW; all other ERS capacity offers will have a minimum amount that may be offered of one-tenth (0.1) MW.  ERS Resources may be aggregated to reach this requirement.
(9)	Offers from ERS Generators must include self-serve capacity and injection capacity amounts greater than or equal to zero for each ERS Time Period offered.
(10)	ERCOT may establish an upper limit, in MWs, on the amount of ERS capacity it will procure for any ERS Time Period in any ERS Standard Contract Term.	
(11)	A QSE’s offer to provide ERS shall include: 
(a)	The name of the QSE representing the ERS Resource and the name of an individual authorized by the QSE to represent the QSE and its ERS Resource(s);
(b)	The name of an Entity that controls the ERS Resource, and an affirmation that the QSE has obtained written authorization from the Entity to submit ERS offers on its behalf and to represent the Entity in all matters before ERCOT concerning the Entity’s provision of ERS;
(c)	Any information or data specified by ERCOT, including access to historical meter data, and affirmation by the QSE that it has obtained written authorization from the controlling Entity of the ERS Resource for the QSE to obtain such data;
(d)	Affirmation that the controlling Entity of the ERS Resource has reviewed P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.507, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Emergency Response Service (ERS), these Protocols and Other Binding Documents relating to the provision of ERS, and has agreed to comply with and be bound by such provisions;
(e)	An agreement by the QSE to produce any written authorization or agreement between the QSE and any ERS Resource it represents, as described in this Section, upon request from ERCOT or the PUCT;
(f)	Affirmation that no offered capacity from any site in an ERS Resource has been or will be committed to provide any other product, service, or program during any of the hours in the ERS Time Period in the Standard Contract Term for which the offer is submitted.  Such prohibited products, services, or programs include, but are not limited to, Ancillary Services, Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED), or TDSP standard offer programs.  As an exception to the foregoing, a QSE may offer a site to provide ERS for an ERS Time Period in the Standard Contract Term even if the QSE has an offer pending for that same site to serve as an MRA during that ERS Time Period and Standard Contract Term; however, if the site is selected to serve as an MRA it will not be permitted to serve as ERS during any ERS Time Period in the ERS Contract Term in which it is obligated to serve as an MRA;
(g)	Affirmation that the QSE and the controlling Entity the ERS Resource are familiar with any applicable federal, state or local environmental regulations that apply to the use of any generator in the provision of ERS, and that the use of such generator(s) to provide of ERS would not violate those regulations.  This provision applies to both ERS Generators and to the use of backup generation by ERS Loads; and
(h)	Affirmation that each offered ERS Resource satisfies at least one of the conditions set forth in paragraph (9) of Section 3.6.1, Load Resource Participation, and that all of the ERS Resource’s offered Demand response capacity will be available if deployed by ERCOT during an emergency.
(12)	Upon request from a QSE, ERCOT shall provide the dates and times for any deployment events or tests of any ERS site during the previous three ERS Standard Contract Terms, provided that the QSE has obtained written authorization from the ERS site to obtain the information from ERCOT.  Such QSE requests shall include the following site-specific information: Electric Service Identifier (ESI ID), unique meter identifier (if applicable), or, if the site is in a Non-Opt-In Entity (NOIE) area, site name and site address.
(13)	Sites associated with a Dynamically Scheduled Resource (DSR) may not participate in ERS.  Offers for Resources containing sites associated with a DSR will be rejected by ERCOT.  If ERCOT determines that any participating site is associated with a DSR, that site will be treated as removed from the Resource on the date the determination was made.  An ERS Resource’s obligation will not change as a result of any such site removal.
[NPRR1000:  Delete item (13) above upon system implementation and renumber accordingly.]
(14)	Each offer submitted by a QSE on behalf of an aggregated ERS Load on a weather-sensitive baseline shall include the QSE’s projection of the maximum number of sites in the aggregation during the ERS Standard Contract Term.  ERCOT shall review this projection and the information provided regarding the initial size of each aggregated ERS Load and shall reject any offer on behalf of such an ERS Load if the maximum size of the ERS Load projected by the QSE would violate the limits of site participation growth described in paragraph (15) below.
(15)	A QSE may modify the population of an aggregated ERS Load on a weather-sensitive baseline once per month during an ERS Standard Contract Term via a process defined by ERCOT.  Such adjustments shall be effective on the first day of each month following the first month.  A fully validated ERS Offer form must be received by ERCOT no later than seven Business Days prior to the first day of the month for which is intended to be in effect.
(a)	During an ERS Standard Contract Term, a QSE may increase the number of sites in an aggregated ERS Load on a weather-sensitive baseline by no more than the greater of the following:
(i)	100% of the initial number of sites; or
(ii)	Two MW times the QSE’s projection of the maximum number of sites in the aggregation during the ERS Standard Contract Term, divided by the maximum MW capacity offered for any ERS Time Period for the aggregation.
(b)	Any sites added to an ERS Load on a weather-sensitive baseline are subject to the same requirements for historical meter data as the other sites in the aggregation, as described in paragraph (4) of Section 8.1.3.1.1.
(16)	For each of the four ERS service types, an ERS Standard Contract Term may consist of a single ERS Contract Period or multiple non-overlapping ERS Contract Periods, as follows:  
(a)	If no ERS Resources’ obligations are exhausted for an ERS service type during an ERS Contract Period pursuant to Section 3.14.3.3, Emergency Response Service Provision and Technical Requirements, the ERS Contract Period for that ERS service type shall terminate at the end of the last Operating Day of the ERS Standard Contract Term.  
(b)	If one or more ERS Resources’ obligations in a given ERS service type are exhausted pursuant to Section 3.14.3.3, the ERS Contract Period for that ERS service type shall terminate at the end of the Operating Day during which the exhaustion occurred.  However, if ERS Resources participating in a service type remain deployed at the end of that Operating Day, the ERS Contract Period for that ERS service type shall terminate at the end of the Operating Day on which those ERS Resources are recalled.
(c)	If an ERS Contract Period terminates as provided in paragraph (b) above, and one or more ERS Resources’ obligations were not exhausted, a new ERS Contract Period for the ERS service type shall begin at hour ending 0100 on the following Operating Day.  This new ERS Contract Period shall terminate as provided in this Section.  
(d)	If ERCOT elects pursuant to paragraph (b) above to renew the obligations of any ERS Resources whose obligations were entirely exhausted, a new ERS Contract Period for the ERS service type shall begin at hour ending 0100 on the Operating Day after ERCOT has notified QSEs that it has elected to renew the obligation.  If a new ERS Contract Period was initiated pursuant to paragraph (c) above on an Operating Day prior to ERCOT issuing a notice of renewal under this paragraph, that ERS Contract Period shall terminate at the end of the Operating Day on which ERCOT notified QSEs that the renewal will take place.  This new ERS Contract Period shall terminate as provided in this Section.
(17)	An ERS Resource currently obligated to provide an ERS service type during an ERS Time Period and ERS Contract Period may be offered to provide service as an MRA during that same ERS Time Period in the ERS Contract Period.  If the ERS Resource is selected to provide service as an MRA during an ERS Time Period in the ERS Contract Period in which it is currently obligated to provide an ERS service type, the ERS Contract Period will be terminated for that ERS service type.  The ERS Contract Period for that ERS service type shall terminate at the end of the Operating Day that is five days before the first Operating Day the ERS Resource is obligated to provide service under the MRA Agreement.  However, if any ERS Resources participating in that ERS service type are currently deployed at the end of the Operating Day the ERS Contract Period is scheduled to terminate, then the ERS Resource’s ERS Contract Period for that ERS service type shall continue until the end of the Operating Day on which all of the ERS Resources participating in that ERS service type have been recalled, at which time the ERS Contract Period will terminate.
(18)	ERS Resources shall be obligated in ERS Contract Periods as follows:  
(a)	Unless an ERS Contract Period is terminated pursuant to paragraph (17) above, for the first ERS Contract Period in an ERS Standard Contract Term, all ERS Resources awarded by ERCOT shall be obligated.
(b)	ERS Resources shall be obligated for 24 hours of cumulative deployment time for any ERS Contract Period during the December through March ERS Standard Contract Term.  The obligated cumulative deployment time for any ERS Contract Period during all other ERS Standard Contract Terms shall be 12 hours.
(c)	For each of any subsequent ERS Contract Periods for a given ERS service type in an ERS Standard Contract Term, any ERS Resource with remaining obligation due to cumulative deployment time of less than the maximum deployment hours specified for the ERS Standard Contract Term in paragraph (b) above at the end of the last ERS Contract Period shall be obligated for only this remaining deployment time in the new ERS Contract Period.  
(d)	For each of any subsequent ERS Contract Periods in an ERS Standard Contract Term, ERCOT may renew the obligations of certain ERS Resources as follows: 
(i)	During the offer submission process, QSEs shall designate on the ERS offer form, which is posted on the ERCOT website, whether an ERS Resource elects to participate in renewal ERS Contract Periods (“renewal opt-in”).  Except as provided in paragraph (iv) below, this election is irrevocable once the ERS Resource has been committed for an ERS Standard Contract Term.
(ii)	If the obligations of one or more ERS Resources are exhausted before the end of an ERS Standard Contract Term, ERCOT shall determine whether to include renewal opt-ins in the subsequent ERS Contract Period.  ERCOT may limit any renewal to one or more ERS Time Periods and/or a specified MW quantity in which obligations have been exhausted.  
(iii)	If ERCOT decides to include renewal opt-ins in a subsequent ERS Contract Period, ERCOT shall promptly notify all ERS QSEs as to the ERS Time Periods and/or any specified MW quantity that it has elected to renew.
(iv)	By the end of the second Business Day in any renewal ERS Contract Period, a QSE may revoke the renewal opt-in status of any of its committed ERS Resources for any subsequent ERS Contract Periods within that ERS Standard Contract Term.  ERCOT shall develop a method for QSEs to communicate such information.
(v)	By the end of the third Business Day in any ERS Contract Period other than the first ERS Contract Period in an ERS Standard Contract Term, ERCOT shall communicate to QSEs a confirmation of the terms of participation for all of their committed ERS Resources.
(19)	In any 12-month period beginning on December 1st and ending on November 30th, ERCOT shall not commit dollars toward ERS in excess of the ERS cost cap, except for the purpose of renewing ERS Resource obligations during a period where ERS has been exhausted.  ERCOT may determine cost limits for each ERS Standard Contract Term in order to ensure that the ERS cost cap is not exceeded.
(20)	If a QSE offers a Weather-Sensitive ERS Load, selects a control group baseline for that ERS Load, and ERCOT determines that the magnitude of the offer relative to the baseline error will prevent accurate determination of the performance, ERCOT shall reject the offer.
(21)	ERCOT shall reduce the available expenditure under the ERS cost cap by the value of the amount of ERS Self-Provision.  ERCOT shall value ERS Self-Provision at the clearing price multiplied by the total MW of ERS Self-Provision during each relevant ERS Time Period.
(22)	ERCOT shall procure ERS Resources for each ERS Time Period using a clearing price.  The Emergency Response Service Procurement Methodology, posted on the ERCOT website, is an Other Binding Document that describes the methodology used by ERCOT to procure ERS.  ERCOT may consider geographic location and its effect on congestion in making ERS awards.  ERCOT may prorate the capacity awarded to an ERS Resource in an ERS Time Period if the capacity offered for that ERS Resource would cost more than the Emergency Response Service Procurement Methodology allows under the time period expenditure limit.  Such proration shall only be done if the QSE indicates on its offer for an ERS Resource that the QSE is willing to have the capacity prorated and also has indicated the lowest prorated capacity limit which is acceptable for that ERS Resource.  If proration would result in an award below an ERS Resource’s designated prorated capacity limit or below the minimum MW offer applicable to the ERS service type as specified in paragraph (8) above, the offer will not be awarded.  
(23)	Payments and Self-Provision credits to QSEs representing ERS Resources are subject to adjustments as described in Section 8.1.3.3, Payment Reductions and Suspension of Qualification of Emergency Response Service Resources and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities.  Deployment of ERS Resources will not result in additional payments other than any payment for which the QSE may be eligible through Real-Time energy imbalance or other ERCOT Settlement process. 
(24)	QSEs representing ERS Resources selected to provide ERS shall execute a Standard Form Emergency Response Service Agreement, as provided in Section 22, Attachment G, Standard Form Emergency Response Service Agreement.
3.14.3.2	Emergency Response Service Self-Provision
(1)	QSEs may self-provide ERS.  A QSE electing to self-provide all or part of its ERS obligation shall provide ERCOT with the following, while adhering to a schedule published by ERCOT:
(a)	The maximum MW of capacity the QSE is willing to self-provide for each ERS Time Period for each of the four ERS service types; and
(b)	A proxy Load Ratio Share (LRS) specific to each ERS Time Period for which an offer is submitted.  Proxy LRS shall be a number between zero and one and determined by the self-providing QSE to represent its estimate of its final LRS to be used in ERS Settlement.
(2)	ERS Self-Provision Capacity Upper Limit is defined as the maximum level of self-provided ERS MW capacity for which a QSE may receive credit at Settlement for each ERS service type.  During the procurement process, a QSE may elect to use a proxy ERS Self-Provision Capacity Upper Limit (based on the proxy LRS it submitted) to reduce its ERS Self-Provision MW for each ERS service type.  After receiving ERS Self-Provision information, ERCOT will award offers for additional MWs of ERS capacity for each ERS service type such that the sum of the following does not exceed the total amount of ERS capacity ERCOT intends to procure for that ERS service type in any one ERS Time Period:  
(a)	ERS capacity awarded through ERS competitive offers; and 
(b)	ERS capacity awarded through ERS Self-Provision offers, where for each self-providing QSE the self-provided capacity offer is the lesser of the amount offered or the QSE’s proxy ERS Self-Provision Capacity Upper Limit.
 (3)	The calculations used to determine a QSE’s proxy ERS Self-Provision Capacity Upper Limit for each ERS service type for the ERS procurement phase are the same as those used to determine the actual ERS Self-Provision Capacity Upper Limit for Settlement, as described in Section 6.6.11.1, Emergency Response Service Capacity Payments, except that:
(a)	Offered ERS capacity is substituted for delivered ERS capacity; and
(b)	A QSE’s proxy LRS is substituted for its actual LRS.
(4)	ERCOT shall compute and provide QSEs offering ERS Self-Provision their proxy ERS Self-Provision Capacity Upper Limit for each ERS service type.  A QSE may then reduce any or all of its self-provision offers such that its revised total ERS Self-Provision capacity is greater than or equal to its proxy ERS Self-Provision Capacity Upper Limit provided by ERCOT.  
(5)	A QSE with reduced ERS Self-Provision capacity shall notify ERCOT of the ERS Resources whose obligations are reduced and the quantity of the revised obligations.  The QSE must provide this information to ERCOT within two Business Days of receiving Notice of the reduced obligation.
(6)	If a QSE reduces its ERS commitment according to these procedures, it will not be obligated to pay ERS charges so long as the ERS Self-Provision capacity it delivers is equal to or greater than its final LRS of the total ERS capacity delivered through offers and ERS Self-Provision, as described in paragraph (2) of Section 6.6.11.2, Emergency Response Service Capacity Charge. 
(7)	A QSE opting for ERS Self-Provision may also offer separate capacity into ERS in the form of a priced offer in the same manner as any other QSE.
(8)	The capacity obligation of a self-provided ERS Resource that is designated for renewal opt-in, as described in paragraph (18) of Section 3.14.3.1, Emergency Response Service Procurement, will be fixed at the original awarded MW level for any subsequent ERS Contract Periods in the ERS Standard Contract Term.
3.14.3.3	Emergency Response Service Provision and Technical Requirements
(1)	If ERCOT deploys ERS, any ERS Resource that is contractually committed to provide the ERS service type deployed during the ERS Time Period that includes all or any part of the first interval of the Sustained Response Period must deploy.  If an ERS Resource does not have an obligation for any part of the first interval of the Sustained Response Period, the ERS Resource is not required to deploy at any time during the Sustained Response Period.
(2)	For purposes of this paragraph, deployment obligation time is the cumulative time during the Sustained Response Period of an event during which an ERS Resource has an obligation.  Deployment obligation time does not include the ramp time.  An ERS Resource shall be subject to the maximum cumulative deployment obligation time for an ERS Contract Period as specified in paragraph (18)(b) of Section 3.14.3.1, Emergency Response Service Procurement, except that for ERS Resources that did not exhaust their obligations in a previous ERS Contract Period within the same ERS Standard Contract Term, the maximum deployment obligation time shall be the remaining deployment obligation time from the previous ERS Contract Period as provided by paragraph (18)(c) of Section 3.14.3.1.  Weather-Sensitive ERS test deployments do not contribute to the calculation of cumulative deployment obligation time.
(3)	Unless ERCOT has received a notice of unavailability in a format prescribed by ERCOT, ERCOT shall assume that a contracted ERS Resource is fully available to provide ERS.
(4)	QSEs and ERS Resources they represent shall meet the following technical requirements: 
(a)	Each ERS Resource, including each member of an aggregated ERS Resource, must have an ESI ID or Resource ID (RID) and dedicated metering, as defined by ERCOT.  An ERS Resource located outside of a competitive service area may use a unique service identifier in lieu of an ESI ID or RID.  ERCOT shall analyze 15-minute interval meter data, adjusted for the deemed actual Distribution Loss Factors (DLFs), for each ERS Resource for purposes of offer analysis, availability and performance measurement.  ERS Resources behind a NOIE meter point shall arrange, preferably with the NOIE TDSP, to provide ERCOT with 15-minute interval meter data subject to ERCOT’s specifications and approval.  ERS Resources behind a Private Use Network’s Settlement Meter point shall provide ERCOT 15-minute interval meter data subject to ERCOT’s specifications and approval.  All generators in an ERS Resource must have TDSP metering capable of measuring energy exported to the ERCOT System and TDSP metering capable of measuring energy imported from the ERCOT System.  The QSE must also ensure that interval metering is installed that measures the output of each site in the ERS Generator and that conforms with the requirements described in P.U.C. SUBST. R. 25.142, Submetering for Apartments, Condominiums, and Mobile Home Parks.  Time stamps shall conform to the requirements in Section 10.9.2, TSP or DSP Metered Entities.  The ERS Resource associated with unique meters in competitive choice areas will be adjusted by the same DLFs as the ESI ID associated with that ERS Resource.  The ERS Resource associated with unique meters in NOIE areas will be adjusted based on a NOIE DSP DLF study submitted to ERCOT pursuant to paragraph (6) of Section 13.3, Distribution Losses.   
(b)	An ERS Resource participating in ERS-10 must be capable of meeting its event performance obligations relevant to its assigned performance evaluation methodology within ten minutes of an ERCOT Dispatch Instruction to its QSE, and must be able to maintain such performance for the entire Sustained Response Period.  An ERS Resource participating in ERS-30 must be capable of meeting its event performance obligations relevant to its assigned performance evaluation methodology within 30 minutes of an ERCOT Dispatch Instruction to its QSE, and must be able to maintain such performance for the entire Sustained Response Period.
(c)	A QSE must be capable of communicating with its ERS Resources in sufficient time to ensure deployment as described in paragraph (b) above.
(d)	QSEs shall communicate to ERCOT, in a method prescribed by ERCOT, material changes in the availability status of their ERS Resources.
(e)	An ERS Resource deployed for ERS must be able to return to a condition such that it is capable of meeting its ERS performance requirements within ten hours following a release Dispatch Instruction.
(f)	ERS Resources and their QSEs are subject to qualification based on ERCOT’s evaluation of their historical meter data and, if applicable, their historic performance in providing other comparable ERCOT services.  ERS Resources and their QSEs are subject to testing requirements as described in Section 8.1.3.2, Testing of Emergency Response Service Resources.  
(g)	ERS Resources are not subject to the modeling, telemetry and COP requirements of other Resources.
(5)	The contracted capacity of ERS Resources may not be used to provide Ancillary Services during a contracted ERS Time Period.  Nothing herein shall be construed to limit passive (voluntary) Load response, provided the ERS Resource meets its performance and availability requirements, as described in Section 8.1.3.1, Performance Criteria for Emergency Response Service Resources.
(6)	QSEs representing ERS Resources must meet the requirements specified in Section 8.1.3.3, Payment Reductions and Suspension of Qualification of Emergency Response Service Resources and/or their Qualified Scheduling Entities.
3.14.3.4	Emergency Response Service Reporting and Market Communications
(1)	ERCOT shall review the effectiveness and benefits of ERS every 12 months from the start of the program year and report its findings to TAC no later than April 15 of each calendar year.
(2)	Prior to the start of the first ERS Contract Period in an ERS Standard Contract Term, and no later than the end of the third Business Day following the start of any subsequent ERS Contract Period in an ERS Standard Contract Term, ERCOT shall post on the ERCOT website the number of MW procured per ERS Time Period, the number and type of ERS Resources selected, and the projected total cost of ERS for that ERS Contract Period.

For purposes of payment under Section 6.6.6.7, the Other Generation MRA’s Monthly Availability Factor will be the ratio of the number of 15-minute intervals the Other Generation MRA was available during the MRA Contracted Month divided by the total number of contracted 15-minute intervals in the MRA Contracted Month. 
(6)	The following intervals will be excluded in ERCOT’s calculations of an MRA’s Monthly Availability Factor, for purposes of payment under Section 6.6.6.7:
(a)	Any 15-minute interval in which an MRA was deployed during an MRA deployment event or an unannounced ERCOT test;

An MRA.
(4)	For each unannounced ERCOT test or MRA deployment of a Demand Response MRA or Other Generation MRA, ERCOT will calculate an MRA Event Performance Reduction Factor (MRAEPRF) as described in paragraph (2) above for the intervals covered by the test/event.  The Event Performance Reduction Factor calculation will begin with the first partial or full interval in the MRA deployment period and will end with the last full interval in the MRA deployment period.
(5)	A Demand Response MRA shall be deemed to have met its test/event performance requirements if it is determined by ERCOT to have met its Demand response obligations in the MRA deployment event as measured using the ERCOT-established baseline that ERCOT determines most accurately represents the Demand Response MRA’s Demand response contribution.
(6)	The MRA deployment period for a Demand Response MRA or Other Generation MRA will end at the time ERCOT issues a release instruction via VDI, or the end of the last MRA Contracted Hour on the day of the deployment, whichever is earlier.  
(7)	Event Performance Reduction Factors are expressed as a number between 0 and 1, rounded to three decimal places.  
(8)	A Demand Response MRA or an Other Generation MRA that achieves an Event Performance Reduction Factor of 0.950 or greater for a test/event and an Interval Performance Factor for the first full interval of the test/event of 0.950 or greater will be deemed to have successfully met its deployment obligations for that test/event.
(9)	If a Demand Response MRA or an Other Generation MRA fails to achieve an Event Performance Reduction Factor of 0.950 or greater, the Interval Performance Factors for that MRA for that event will be multiplied by an adjustment factor such that the Event Performance Reduction Factor for the test/event will be equal to the square of the original event performance factor.
(10)	If a Demand Response MRA has been classified by ERCOT as providing Weather-Sensitive MRA, and if ERCOT determines that the normalized peak Demand reduction value for the Demand Response MRA is greater than 95% of the largest contracted capacity value offered in any MRA Contracted Hour by the QSE for the Demand Response MRA, ERCOT shall not apply the adjustment factors as specified in paragraph (9) above.  To determine the normalized peak Demand reduction value, ERCOT shall:
(a) 	Calculate an average Demand reduction value across the intervals for each test and/or actual deployment event during the MRA contract period.  For this purpose the Demand reduction value for an interval shall be calculated as the greater of zero or effective base MW for the interval less the effective actual MW for the interval; and
(b)	Model the relationship of the average Demand reduction values determined in paragraph (a) above to actual weather and use the derived normalized peak Demand reduction value as the value that would be realized under normalized peak weather conditions.
(11)	For any contracted month in which ERCOT has deployed one or more Demand Response MRAs or Other Generation MRAs more than once for either an unannounced test or an MRA deployment, the Event Performance Reduction Factor (MRAEPRF) as described in paragraph (2) above for the MRA for the contracted month shall be the time-weighted average of the interval performance factor values for all tests/events in the Contracted Month.  The interval performance factors used for this calculation shall reflect any squaring applied pursuant to paragraph (9) above.

(2)	If a Demand Response MRA has been deemed by ERCOT to be co-located with an Other Generation MRA, the event performance of the two Resources shall be calculated as a combination.  For the calculations described in paragraph (2) of Section 3.14.4.6.5, MRA Event Performance Measurement and Verification, the effective base MW of the combination shall be the sum of the values calculated for the Demand Response MRA and Other Generation MRA, the effective actual MW shall be the sum of the values calculated for the Demand Response MRA and Other Generation MRA, and the effective contract capacity MW shall be the sum of the values calculated for the Demand Response MRA and Other Generation MRA.
(3)	For the calculations described in paragraph (3) of Section 3.14.4.6.5, the MRAEPRF for the co-located combination shall be calculated as the time-weighted average of the interval performance factors calculated for the combination of the Demand Response MRA and Other Generation MRA. The steps described in paragraphs (4) through (10) of Section 3.14.4.6.5 shall be followed for the combination of the Demand Response MRA and Other Generation MRA, and the MRAEPRF for the Demand Response MRA and Other Generation MRA for the MRA Contracted Month shall be equal to the MRAEPRF calculated for the combination for the MRA Contracted Month.

(2)	ERCOT shall issue an RFP by August 1 of each year soliciting offers from QSEs for Generation Resources to provide FFSS.  The RFP shall require offers to be submitted on or before September 1 of each year. 
(3)	QSEs may submit offers individually for one or more Generation Resources to provide FFSS using the FFSS Offer Submission Form posted on the ERCOT website.  A QSE may not submit an offer for a given Generation Resource unless it is the QSE designated by the Resource Entity associated with that Generation Resource.  ERCOT must evaluate offers using criteria identified in an appendix to the RFP.  ERCOT will issue FFSS awards by September 30 and will post the awards to the MIS Certified Area for each QSE that is awarded an FFSS obligation.  The posting will include information such as, but not limited to, the identity of the primary Generation Resource and any alternate Generation Resource(s), the FFSS clearing price, the amount of reserved fuel associated with the FFSS award, the MW amount awarded, and the Generation Resource’s initial minimum LSL when providing FFSS.  The RFP awards shall cover a period beginning November 15 of the year in which the RFP is issued and ending on March 15 of the year after the year in which the RFP is issued.  A QSE may submit an offer for one or more Generation Resources to provide FFSS beginning in the same year the RFP is issued or as otherwise specified in the RFP.  An FFSS Resource (FFSSR) shall be considered an FFSSR and is required to provide FFSS from November 15 through March 15 for each year of the awarded FFSS obligation period.  ERCOT shall ensure FFSSRs are procured and deployed as necessary to maintain ERCOT System reliability during, or in preparation for, a natural gas curtailment or other fuel supply disruption.
(a)	On the FFSS Offer Submission Form, the QSE shall disclose information including, but not limited to, the Generation Resource and any alternate Generation Resource(s), the amount of reserved fuel offered, the MW available from the capacity offered, an estimate of the time to restock fuel reserves, and each limitation of the offered Generation Resource that could affect the Generation Resource’s ability to provide FFSS.  
(b)	If the QSE offers a Generation Resource as meeting the qualification requirements in paragraph (1)(c) of Section 8.1.1.2.1.6, Firm Fuel Supply Service Resource Qualification, Testing, Decertification, and Recertification, the QSE must submit as part of its offer a certification for the offered Generation Resource.  The certification must include:  
(i)	Certification that the Generation Entity for the Generation Resource (or an Affiliate) has a Firm Transportation Agreement, firm natural gas supply, and contracted or owned storage capacity meeting the qualification requirements in paragraph (1)(c) of Section 8.1.1.2.1.6;

(c)	For a Generation Resource to be eligible to receive an FFSS award, the primary Generation Resource and any alternate Generation Resource(s) identified in the FFSS Offer Submission Form shall complete all applicable testing requirements as specified in Section 8.1.1.2.1.6.  A QSE representing an FFSSR is allowed to provide the FFSS with an alternate Resource previously approved by ERCOT to replace the FFSSR.
(d)	An offer to provide FFSS is an offer to supply an awarded amount of capacity, maintain a sufficient amount of reserved fuel to meet that award for the duration requirement specified in the RFP, and to designate a specific number of emissions hours that will be reserved for the awarded FFSSR in meeting its obligation to perform in the event that FFSS is deployed.  Reserved fuel, emissions hours, and other attributes, in excess of what is needed to meet the FFSS obligation can be used at the discretion of the QSE as long as sufficient fuel reserves and emissions hours are maintained for the purposes of ERCOT deployment of FFSS.  
(e)	Within ten Business Days of issuing FFSS awards, ERCOT will post on the ERCOT website the identity of all Generation Resources that were offered as primary Generation Resources or alternate Generation Resources to provide FFSS for the most recent procurement period, including prices and quantities offered.
(4)	The QSE for an FFSSR shall ensure that the Resource is prepared and able to come On-Line or remain On-Line in order to maintain Resource availability in the event of a natural gas curtailment or other fuel supply disruption. 
(a)	When ERCOT issues a Watch for winter weather, ERCOT will notify all Market Participants, including all QSEs representing FFSSRs, to begin preparation for potential FFSS deployment.  Such preparation may include, but is not limited to, circulation of alternate fuel to its facilities, if applicable; heat fuel oil to appropriate temperatures, if applicable; call out additional personnel as necessary, and be ready to receive a Dispatch Instruction to provide FFSS.  An FFSSR may begin consuming a minimum amount of alternate fuel to validate it is ready for an FFSS deployment.
(b)	In anticipation of or in the event of a natural gas curtailment or other fuel supply disruption to an FFSSR, the QSE shall notify ERCOT as soon as practicable and may request approval to deploy FFSS to generate electricity.  ERCOT shall evaluate system conditions and may approve the QSE’s request.  The QSE shall not deploy the FFSS unless approved by ERCOT.  Upon approval to deploy FFSS, ERCOT shall issue an FFSS VDI to the QSE.  ERCOT may issue separate VDIs for each Operating Day for each FFSSR that is deployed for FFSS.
(c)	In conjunction with a QSE notification under paragraph (b) above, the QSE shall also report to ERCOT any environmental limitations that would impair the ability of the FFSSR to provide FFSS for the required duration of the FFSS award.
(d)	ERCOT may issue an FFSS VDI without a request from the QSE, however ERCOT shall not issue an FFSS VDI without evidence of an impending or actual fuel supply disruption affecting the FFSSR. 
(e)	If the FFSSR is generating at a level above the FFSS MW awarded amount and that level of output cannot be sustained for the required duration of the FFSS award, ERCOT may use a manual High Dispatch Limit (HDL) override to ensure the FFSSR can continue to generate at the FFSS MW award level for the entire FFSS duration requirement specified in the RFP.
(f)	The FFSSR shall continuously deploy FFSS to generate electricity until the earlier of (i) the exhaustion of the fuel reserved to generate at the FFSS MW award level for the duration requirement specified in the RFP, including any fuel that was restocked following approval or instruction from ERCOT, (ii) the fuel supply disruption no longer exists, or (iii) ERCOT determines the FFSS deployment is no longer needed.  Upon satisfying one of these qualifications, ERCOT shall terminate the VDI and the FFSSR shall not be obligated to continue its FFSS deployment for the remainder of the Watch.
(g)	The QSE for the FFSSR is responsible for communicating with the ERCOT control room the anticipated exhaustion of the reserved fuel at least six hours before that anticipated exhaustion and upon the exhaustion of that fuel.
(h)	A QSE shall notify the ERCOT control room of the anticipated exhaustion of emissions credits or permit allowances at least six hours before the exhaustion of those credits or allowances.  Upon receiving such notification, ERCOT shall modify the VDI so the FFSS deployment is terminated upon exhaustion of those credits or allowances.
(i)	Upon deployment or recall of FFSS, ERCOT shall notify all Market Participants that such deployment or recall has been made, including the MW capacity of service deployed or recalled.
(5)	Following the deployment of FFSS, the QSE for an FFSSR may request an approval from ERCOT to restock their fuel reserve to restore their ability to generate at the FFSS MW award level for the duration requirement specified in the RFP.  Following approval from ERCOT, a QSE must restock their fuel reserve to restore their ability to generate at the FFSS MW award level for the specified duration requirement.  In the event ERCOT does not receive the request to restock from a QSE representing an FFSSR, but the QSE no longer has sufficient reserved fuel to generate at the FFSS MW award level for the specified duration requirement, the QSE shall communicate to the ERCOT control room this reduced capability and ERCOT may instruct the QSE to restock the fuel reserve.
(6)	For a Resource to be considered as an alternate for providing FFSS, the following requirements must be met.  The alternate Resource must:
(a)	Be able to provide net real power sufficient to generate at the same FFSS MW award level as the primary Resource for the duration requirement specified in the RFP;
(b)	Be a single Generation Resource, as registered with ERCOT; and 
(c)	Use the same source of fuel reserve for providing FFSS as the primary Resource.
(7)       An FFSS Offer Submission Form may have up to three alternate Generation Resources per primary Resource offering to provide FFSS.  
(8)	For FFSSRs with approved alternate Generation Resources if the FFSSR becomes unavailable, the QSE must: 
(a)	As soon as practicable, call the ERCOT control room and inform an Operator that the FFSSR will be replaced by one of the alternate Generation Resource, specify which alternate Generation Resource (if multiple alternate Generation Resources have been designated), and provide an estimate of how long the replacement will be in effect;
(b)	Update the Availability Plans for these Generation Resources to reflect current operating conditions within 60 minutes after identifying the change in availability of the FFSSR; and 
(c)	Update the COPs for these Generation Resources within 60 minutes after identifying the change in availability of the FFSSR.
(9)	An FFSSR providing BSS must have sufficient fuel reserved to generate at the FFSS MW award level for the duration requirement specified in the RFP in addition to any fuel required for the Generation Resource to meet the contracted BSS obligation.  Any remaining fuel reserve in addition to that required for meeting FFSS and BSS obligations can be used at the QSE’s discretion.
(10)	If ERCOT issues an FFSS VDI to an FFSSR for the same Operating Hour where a RUC instruction was issued, then for Settlement purposes ERCOT will consider the RUC instruction as cancelled.
(11)	If FFSS is deployed, then ERCOT will provide a report to the TAC or its designated subcommittee within 30 days of the end of the FFSS obligation period.  The report must include the Resources deployed and the reason for any deployments. 
(12)	Any QSE that submits an offer or receives an award for a SWGR to provide FFSS, and the Resource Entity that owns or controls that SWGR, shall: 
(a)	Not nominate the SWGR to satisfy supply adequacy or capacity planning requirements in any Control Area other than the ERCOT Region during the period of the FFSS obligation; and
(b)	Take any further action requested by ERCOT to ensure that ERCOT will be classified as the “Primary Party” for the SWGR under any agreement between ERCOT and another CAO during the period of the FFSS obligation.

3.15	Voltage Support
(1)	ERCOT, in coordination with the Transmission Service Providers (TSPs), shall establish and update, as necessary, the ERCOT System Voltage Profile and shall post it on the Market Information System (MIS) Secure Area.  ERCOT, the interconnecting TSP, or that TSP’s agent, may modify the Voltage Set Point described in the Voltage Profile based on current system conditions. 
(2)	All Generation Resources (including self-serve generating units) and Energy Storage Resources (ESRs) that are connected to Transmission Facilities and that have a gross unit rating greater than 20 MVA or those units connected at the same Point of Interconnection Bus (POIB) that have gross unit ratings aggregating to greater than 20 MVA, that supply power to the ERCOT Transmission Grid, shall provide Voltage Support Service (VSS).
(3)	Except as reasonably necessary to ensure reliability or operational efficiency, TSPs should utilize available static reactive devices prior to requesting a Voltage Set Point change from a Generation Resource or ESR.
(4)	Each Generation Resource and ESR required to provide VSS shall comply with the following Reactive Power requirements in Real-Time operations when issued a Voltage Set Point by a TSP or ERCOT:  
(a)	An over-excited (lagging or producing) power factor capability of 0.95 or less determined at the unit's maximum net power to be supplied to the ERCOT Transmission Grid and for any Voltage Set Point from 0.95 per unit to 1.04 per unit, as measured at the POIB;
(b)	An under-excited (leading or absorbing) power factor capability of 0.95 or less, determined at the unit's maximum net power to be supplied to the ERCOT Transmission Grid and for any Voltage Set Point from 1.0 per unit to 1.05 per unit, as measured at the POIB;  
(c)	For any Voltage Set Point outside of the voltage ranges described in paragraphs (a) and (b) above, the Generation Resource or ESR shall supply or absorb the maximum amount of Reactive Power available within its inherent capability and the capability of any VAr-capable devices as necessary to achieve the Voltage Set Point;
(d)	When a Generation Resource or an ESR required to provide VSS is issued a new Voltage Set Point, that Generation Resource or ESR shall make adjustments in response to the new Voltage Set Point, regardless of whether the current voltage is within the tolerances identified in paragraph (4) of Nodal Operating Guide Section 2.7.3.5, Resource Entity Responsibilities and Generation Resource and Energy Storage Resource Requirements;
(e)	For Generation Resources, the Reactive Power capability shall be available at all MW output levels and may be met through a combination of the Generation Resource’s Corrected Unit Reactive Limit (CURL), which is the generating unit’s dynamic leading and lagging operating capability, and/or dynamic VAr-capable devices.  This Reactive Power profile is depicted graphically as a rectangle.  For Intermittent Renewable Resources (IRRs), the Reactive Power requirements shall be available at all MW output levels at or above 10% of the IRR’s nameplate capacity.  When an IRR is operating below 10% of its nameplate capacity and is unable to support voltage at the POIB, ERCOT, the interconnecting TSP, or that TSP’s agent may require an IRR to disconnect from the ERCOT System for purposes of maintaining reliability.  For ESRs, the Reactive Power capability shall be available at all MW levels, when charging or discharging, and may be met through a combination of the ESR’s CURL, and/or dynamic VAr-capable devices.  For any ESR that achieved Initial Synchronization before December 16, 2019, the requirement to have Reactive Power capability when charging does not apply if the Resource Entity for the ESR has submitted a notarized attestation to ERCOT stating that, since the date of Initial Synchronization, the ESR has been unable to comply with this requirement without physical or software changes/modifications, and ERCOT has provided written confirmation of the exemption to the Resource Entity.  The exemption shall apply only to the extent of the ESR’s inability to comply with the requirement when the ESR is charging.
(f)	For any Generation Resource or Energy Storage Resource (ESR) that is part of a Self-Limiting Facility, the capabilities described in paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be determined based on the Self-Limiting Facility’s established MW Injection limit and, if applicable, established MW Withdrawal limit.
(5)	As part of the technical Resource testing requirements prior to the Resource Commissioning Date, all Generation Resources and ESRs must conduct an engineering study, and demonstrate through performance testing, the ability to comply with the Reactive Power capability requirements in paragraph (4), (7), (8), or (9) of this Section, as applicable.  Any study and testing results must be accepted by ERCOT prior to the Resource Commissioning Date.
(6)	Except for a Generation Resource or an ESR subject to Planning Guide Section 5.2.1, Applicability, a Generation Resource or an ESR that has already been commissioned is not required to submit a new reactive study or conduct commissioning-related reactive testing, as described in paragraph (5) above.
(7)	Wind-powered Generation Resources (WGRs) that commenced operation on or after February 17, 2004, and have a signed Standard Generation Interconnection Agreement (SGIA) on or before December 1, 2009 (“Existing Non-Exempt WGRs”), must be capable of producing a defined quantity of Reactive Power to maintain a set point in the Voltage Profile established by ERCOT in accordance with the Reactive Power requirements established in paragraph (4) above, except in the circumstances described in paragraph (a) below.  
(a)	Existing Non-Exempt WGRs whose current design does not allow them to meet the Reactive Power requirements established in paragraph (4) above must conduct an engineering study using the Summer/Fall 2010 on-peak/off-peak Voltage Profiles, or conduct performance testing to determine their actual Reactive Power capability.  Any study or testing results must be accepted by ERCOT.  The Reactive Power requirements applicable to these Existing Non-Exempt WGRs will be the greater of: the leading and lagging Reactive Power capabilities established by the Existing Non-Exempt WGR’s engineering study or testing results; or Reactive Power proportional to the real power output of the Existing Non-Exempt WGR (this Reactive Power profile is depicted graphically as a triangle) sufficient to provide an over-excited (lagging) power factor capability of 0.95 or less and an under-excited (leading) power factor capability of 0.95 or less, both determined at the WGR’s set point in the Voltage Profile established by ERCOT, and both measured at the POIB.
(i)	Existing Non-Exempt WGRs shall submit the engineering study results or testing results to ERCOT no later than five Business Days after its completion.
(ii)	Existing Non-Exempt WGRs shall update any and all Resource Registration data regarding their Reactive Power capability documented by the engineering study results or testing results.
(iii)	If the Existing Non-Exempt WGR’s engineering study results or testing results indicate that the WGR is not able to provide Reactive Power capability that meets the triangle profile described in paragraph (a) above, then the Existing Non-Exempt WGR will take steps necessary to meet that Reactive Power requirement depicted graphically as a triangle by a date mutually agreed upon by the Existing Non-Exempt WGR and ERCOT.  The Existing Non-Exempt WGR may meet the Reactive Power requirement through a combination of the WGR’s Unit Reactive Limit (URL) and/or automatically switchable static VAr-capable devices and/or dynamic VAr-capable devices.  No later than five Business Days after completion of the steps to meet that Reactive Power requirement, the Existing Non-Exempt WGR will update any and all Resource Registration data regarding its Reactive Power and provide written notice to ERCOT that it has completed the steps necessary to meet its Reactive Power requirement.
(iv)	For purposes of measuring future compliance with Reactive Power requirements for Existing Non-Exempt WGRs, results from performance testing or the Summer/Fall 2010 on-peak/off-peak Voltage Profiles utilized in the Existing Non-Exempt WGR’s engineering study shall be the basis for measuring compliance, even if the Voltage Profiles provided to the Existing Non-Exempt WGR are revised for other purposes.
(b)	Existing Non-Exempt WGRs whose current design allows them to meet the Reactive Power requirements established in paragraph (4) above (depicted graphically as a rectangle) shall continue to comply with that requirement.  ERCOT, with cause, may request that these Existing Non-Exempt WGRs provide further evidence, including an engineering study, or performance testing, to confirm accuracy of Resource Registration data supporting their Reactive Power capability.
(8)	Qualified Renewable Generation Resources (as described in Section 14, State of Texas Renewable Energy Credit Trading Program) in operation before February 17, 2004, required to provide VSS and all other Generation Resources required to provide VSS that were in operation prior to September 1, 1999, whose current design does not allow them to meet the Reactive Power requirements established in paragraph (4) above, will be required to maintain a Reactive Power requirement as defined by the Generation Resource’s URL that was submitted to ERCOT and established per the criteria in the ERCOT Operating Guides.
(9)	New generating units connected before May 17, 2005, whose owners demonstrate to ERCOT’s satisfaction that design and/or equipment procurement decisions were made prior to February 17, 2004, based upon previous standards, whose design does not allow them to meet the Reactive Power requirements established in paragraph (4) above, will be required to maintain a Reactive Power requirement as defined by the Generation Resource’s URL that was submitted to ERCOT and established per the criteria in the Operating Guides.
(10)	For purposes of meeting the Reactive Power requirements in paragraphs (4) through (9) above, multiple units including IRRs shall, at a Resource Entity’s option, be treated as a single Resource if the units are connected to the same transmission bus.
(11)	Resource Entities may submit to ERCOT specific proposals to meet the Reactive Power requirements established in paragraph (4) above by employing a combination of the CURL and added VAr capability, provided that the added VAr capability shall be automatically switchable static and/or dynamic VAr devices.

(1)	The Constraint Competitiveness Test (CCT) checks the competitiveness of a constraint by evaluating each Market Participant’s ability to exercise market power by physical or economic withholding.  The CCT for a constrained Transmission Element evaluates whether there is sufficient competition to resolve the constraint on the import side by calculating the Element Competitiveness Index (ECI) on the import side of the constraint and by determining whether a single Entity is needed to resolve the constraint. 
(2)	The competitiveness of a constraint is tested both on a long-term basis and before each Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) execution. 
(3)	The “Available Capacity for a Resource” is defined as follows:
(a)	For Generation Resources, including Switchable Generation Resources (SWGRs), but excluding Intermittent Renewable Resources (IRRs):
(i)	Long-Term CCT - the Seasonal net max sustainable rating, as registered with ERCOT.
(ii)	SCED CCT - the telemetered High Sustained Limit (HSL) for Resources with telemetered Resource Status as specified in paragraph (5)(b)(i) of Section 3.9.1, Current Operating Plan (COP) Criteria, and zero for all other Resources.

SUBST. R. 25.502, Pricing Safeguards in Markets Operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.
(5)	Shift Factors of all Electrical Buses are computed relative to the distributed load reference Bus.

(2)	ERCOT will determine the ECI on the import of the constraint, as follows:
(a)	Determine the total ECI Effective Capacity by each DME on the import side.  
(b)	Determine the percentage of ECI Effective Capacity by each DME on the import side by taking each DME’s ECI Effective Capacity and dividing by the total ECI Effective Capacity on the import side.
(c)	The ECI on the import side is equal to the sum of the squares of the percentages of ECI Effective Capacity for each DME on the import side.
3.19.3	Long-Term Constraint Competitiveness Test

(3)	A constraint is classified as a Competitive Constraint for the monthly case if it meets all of the following conditions:
(a)	The ECI is less than ECIT1 on the import side of the constraint;
(b)	The constraint can be resolved by eliminating all Available Capacity for a Resource on the import side, except nuclear capacity and minimum-energy amounts of coal and lignite capacity, that is Managed Capacity for a DME during peak Load conditions; and

(5)	ERCOT shall update and post the list of Competitive Constraints identified by the Long-Term CCT on the MIS Secure Area.  The list of Competitive Constraints shall be posted at least 30 days prior to the first of the year.
3.19.4	Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch Constraint Competitiveness Test
(1)	The SCED CCT uses current system conditions to evaluate the competitiveness of a constraint.

(a)	The ECI is less than ECIT2 on the import side;
(b)	The constraint can be resolved by eliminating all Available Capacity for a Resource on the import side, except nuclear capacity and minimum-energy amounts of coal and lignite capacity, that is Managed Capacity for a DME.  If the constraint cannot be resolved, then the DME will be marked as the pivotal player for resolving the constraint;

(4)	A constraint that is determined to be a Non-Competitive Constraint by the SCED CCT within an Operating Hour will not be re-evaluated for its competitiveness status for the remainder of that Operating Hour.  However, the SCED CCT will reevaluate the percentage of the ECI Effective Capacity on the import side for each DME and whether the DME is a pivotal player for the constraint.  SCED will re-evaluate the competitiveness of the Non-Competitive Constraint starting with the first SCED interval of the next Operating Hour if the constraint remains active in SCED.
(5)	The Independent Market Monitor (IMM) may designate any constraint as a Competitive Constraint or a Non-Competitive Constraint.  ERCOT shall provide notice describing any such designation by the IMM.  The notice shall include an effective date, justification for the constraint designation by the IMM and the duration for which the IMM designation will be applied.  Any such designation from the IMM shall override the competitiveness status determined by the SCED CCT for the dates for which the IMM override is effective.

(2)	If a Resource Entity or its QSE knows an activity or condition related to a natural gas pipeline directly connected to its Generation Resource will cause the Generation Resource’s unavailability, in whole or in part, the QSE shall, as soon as practicable, report that Outage or derate in the ERCOT Outage Scheduler in accordance with Section 3.1, Outage Coordination.  An Outage or derate reported in the ERCOT Outage Scheduler need not be disclosed in the declaration contained in Section 22, Attachment K, nor reported under paragraph (4) below. 
(3)	If, before a Resource Entity submits the declaration contained in Section 22, Attachment K, the Resource Entity or its QSE is notified by an operator of a natural gas pipeline directly connected to its Generation Resource of an activity or condition (e.g. maintenance, inspection, malfunction, or third-party damage) that may limit or impede normal deliveries but is uncertain whether the activity or condition during the upcoming summer Peak Load Season will cause the Generation Resource to take an Outage or derate, the Resource Entity shall disclose the natural gas pipeline activity or condition in the declaration contained in Section 22, Attachment K, if the activity or condition materially increases the risk of Generation Resource unavailability during the summer Peak Load Season.  The Resource Entity shall use its reasonable judgment to determine whether there is a material increase in the risk of unavailability.
(4)	If, after submitting the declaration contained in Section 22, Attachment K, any previously disclosed information changes or a Resource Entity or its QSE receives new information about an activity or condition that may limit or impede normal natural gas deliveries and materially increases the risk of Generation Resource unavailability during the summer Peak Load Season, the Resource Entity shall disclose that information to ERCOT as soon as practicable.

For Tier 4 projects that include Transmission Facilities connecting to or operating at 345 kV, the TSP shall provide the SSR assessment for ERCOT’s review.  For the purposes of this Section, a Generation Resource is considered an existing Generation Resource if it satisfies Planning Guide Section 6.9 at the time the Transmission Facilities are proposed.
(2)	If while performing the independent review of a transmission project, ERCOT determines that the transmission project may cause an existing Generation Resource or a Generation Resource satisfying Planning Guide Section 6.9 at the time the transmission project is proposed to become vulnerable to SSR, ERCOT shall perform an SSR vulnerability assessment, including topology-check and frequency scan in accordance with Section 3.22.2 if such an assessment was not included in the project submission.  ERCOT shall include a summary of the results of this assessment in the independent review.
(3)	If the frequency scan assessment in paragraphs (1) or (2) above indicates potential SSR vulnerability in accordance with Section 3.22.2, the TSP(s) that owns the affected series capacitor(s), in coordination with the TSP proposing the Transmission Facilities, shall perform a detailed SSR assessment to confirm or refute the SSR vulnerability. 
(4)	Past SSR assessments may be used to determine the SSR vulnerability of a Generation Resource if ERCOT, in consultation with the affected TSPs, determines the results of the past SSR assessments are still valid.  
(5)	If the SSR study confirms a Generation Resource is vulnerable to SSR in the event of four or less concurrent transmission Outages, the TSP that owns the affected series capacitor(s) shall coordinate with ERCOT, the affected Resource Entity, and affected TSPs to develop and implement SSR Mitigation on the ERCOT transmission system.

(b)	If ERCOT identifies that a Generation Resource will become radial to series capacitors(s) in the event of less than 14 concurrent transmission Outages, ERCOT shall perform a frequency scan assessment in accordance with Section 3.22.2, Subsynchronous Resonance Vulnerability Assessment Criteria.  ERCOT shall prepare a report to summarize the results of the frequency scan assessment and provide it to the Resource Entity and the affected TSP.
(i)	If the frequency scan assessment described in paragraph (b) above shows the Generation Resource has potential SSR vulnerability in the event of six or fewer concurrent transmission Outages, the TSP(s) that owns the affected series capacitor compensated Transmission Element in coordination with the interconnecting TSP shall perform a detailed SSR assessment to confirm or refute the SSR vulnerability. 
(ii)	Past SSR assessments may be used to determine the SSR vulnerability of a Generation Resource if ERCOT, in consultation with the affected TSPs, determines the results of the past SSR assessments are still valid.  
(iii)	If the SSR study confirms the Generation Resource is vulnerable to SSR in the event of four or less concurrent transmission Outages, the TSP that owns the affected series capacitor compensated Transmission Element shall coordinate with ERCOT, the affected Resource Entity, and affected TSPs to develop and install SSR Mitigation on the ERCOT transmission system. The SSR Mitigation shall be developed, if required, and implemented prior to the latter of the energization of the transmission project or the Initial Synchronization of the Generation Resource.
(iv)	If the SSR study confirms the Generation Resource is vulnerable to SSR in the event of five or six concurrent transmission Outages, ERCOT shall implement SSR monitoring in accordance with Section 3.22.3, Subsynchronous Resonance Monitoring, prior to the latter of energization of the transmission project or the Initial Synchronization of the Generation Resource.
(v) 	The Resource Entity shall provide sufficient model data to ERCOT within 60 days of receipt of the data request.  ERCOT, in its sole discretion, may extend the response deadline.
3.22.2	Subsynchronous Resonance Vulnerability Assessment Criteria
(1)	A Generation Resource is considered to be potentially vulnerable to SSR in the topology-check if a Generation Resource will become radial to a series capacitors(s) in the event of less than 14 concurrent transmission Outages.  A frequency scan assessment and/or a detailed SSR assessment shall be required to screen for system conditions causing potential SSR vulnerability.
(2)	In determining whether a Generation Resource is considered to be potentially vulnerable to SSR in the frequency scan assessment results, the following criteria shall be considered:
(a) 	Induction Generator Effect (IGE) and Subsynchronous Control Interaction (SSCI): 
(i)	When considering the total impedance of the generator and the applicable part of the ERCOT System, if the total resistance is negative at a reactance crossover of zero Ohms from negative to positive with increasing frequency, then the generator is considered to be potentially vulnerable to IGE/SSCI; 
(b) 	Torsional Interaction: 
(i)	If the sum of the electrical damping (De) plus the mechanical damping (Dm) results in a negative value then the generator is potentially vulnerable to Torsional Interaction.  Dm at +/- 1 Hz of the modal frequency may be utilized to compare to De; and 
(c) 	Torque Amplification: 
(i)	When considering the total impedance of the generator and the ERCOT system, if a 5% or greater reactance dip, or a reactance crossover of zero Ohms from negative to positive with increasing frequency, occurs within a +/- 3 Hz complement of the modal frequency, then the generator is considered to be potentially vulnerable to Torque Amplification.  The percentage of a reactance dip is on the basis of the reactance maximum at the first inflection point of the dip where the reactance begins to decrease with increasing frequency.
(3)	The detailed SSR assessment shall include an electromagnetic transient program analysis or similar analysis.  A Generation Resource is considered to be vulnerable to SSR if any of the following criteria are met:
(a)	The SSR vulnerability results in more than 50% of fatigue life expenditure over the expected lifetime of the unit;   
(i)	If the fatigue life expenditure is not available, the highest torsional torque caused by SSR is more than 110% of the torque experienced during a transmission fault with the series capacitors bypassed;
(b)	The oscillation, if occurred, is not damped; or
(c)	The oscillation, if occurred, results in disconnection of any transmission and generation facilities.  
3.22.3 	Subsynchronous Resonance Monitoring
(1)	For purposes of SSR monitoring, a common tower Outage loss of a double-circuit transmission line consisting of two circuits sharing a tower for 0.5 miles or greater is considered as one contingency.
(2)	ERCOT’s responsibilities for SSR monitoring shall consist of the following activities if a Generation Resource is vulnerable to SSR in the event of five or six concurrent transmission Outages identified in the SSR vulnerability assessment and does not implement SSR Mitigation: 
(a)	ERCOT shall identify the combinations of Outages of Transmission Elements that may result in SSR vulnerability and provide these Transmission Elements to the affected Resource Entity and its interconnected TSP;
(b)	ERCOT shall monitor the status of these Transmission Elements identified in paragraph (a) above; 
(c)	If the occurrence of Forced and/or Planned Outages results in a Generation Resource being three contingencies away from SSR vulnerability, ERCOT will identify options for mitigation that would be implemented if an additional transmission Outage were to occur, including communications with TSPs to determine potential Outage cancellations and time estimates to reinstate Transmission Facilities;
(d)	If the occurrence of Forced and/or Planned Outages results in a Generation Resource being two contingencies away from SSR vulnerability, ERCOT shall take action to mitigate SSR vulnerability to the affected Generation Resource.  ERCOT shall consider the actions in the following order unless reliability considerations dictate a different order.  Actions that may be considered are:
(i)	No action if the affected Generation Resource is equipped with SSR Protection and has elected for ERCOT to forego action to mitigate SSR vulnerability; 
(ii)	Coordinate with TSPs to withdraw or restore an Outage within eight hours if feasible;
(iii)	If the actions described in (i) and (ii) above are not feasible, ERCOT shall promptly take necessary steps to identify and mitigate the impacts to the ERCOT System caused by bypassing the affected series capacitor(s) and direct the TSP(s) to bypass the affected series capacitors(s); or
(iv)	Other actions specific to the situation, including, but not limited to, Verbal Dispatch Instruction (VDI) to the Resource’s Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE).  
(e)	If the occurrence of Forced and/or Planned Outages results in a Generation Resource being one contingency away from SSR vulnerability, ERCOT shall promptly take necessary steps to identify and mitigate the impacts to the ERCOT System caused by bypassing the affected series capacitor(s) and direct the TSP(s) to bypass the affected series capacitor(s).
(f)	If the occurrence of Forced and/or Planned Outages results in a Generation Resource being two or less contingencies away from SSR vulnerability, ERCOT shall notify the QSE representing the affected Generation Resource by voice communication as soon as practicable that the SSR vulnerability scenario has occurred; initiate the mitigation actions described in paragraphs (2)(d)(i) through (iv) above; and provide additional notifications to the QSE of each relevant topology change until the affected Generation Resource(s) is at least three contingencies away from SSR vulnerability.
3.23	Agreements between ERCOT and other Control Area Operators
(1)	Prior to executing any agreement with another Control Area Operator concerning coordination of Switchable Generation Resources (SWGRs), Direct Current Ties (DC Ties), Block Load Transfers (BLTs), or other operational issues, ERCOT shall, to the extent possible, provide Notice to all Market Participants of such agreement and at least 14 days to comment.  Amendments or modifications to such existing agreements shall also comply with this provision.
(2)	ERCOT shall consider all comments received in response to the Notice and, to the extent time allows, discuss its acceptance or rejection of comments with the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and the ERCOT Board prior to execution.
(3)	ERCOT shall provide Notice to all Market Participants following execution of any such agreement within two Business Days.
3.24	Notification of Low Coal and Lignite Inventory Levels
(1)	Each Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) representing a Generation Resource that uses coal or lignite as its primary fuel, except as provided in paragraph (2) below, shall notify ERCOT of the following:
(a)	If the coal or lignite inventory level available for Real-Time operations is projected to fall below 15 days of operation at the High Sustained Limit (HSL) within the next 90 days, the QSE shall notify ERCOT within three days of such a projection and provide an explanation of any disruption to the coal or lignite supply.  Notifications to ERCOT should be via email, sent to FuelSupply@ERCOT.com.
(b)	If the coal or lignite inventory level available for Real-Time operations is projected to fall below 10 days of operation at the HSL within the next 90 days, the QSE shall notify ERCOT immediately of such a projection, provide an explanation of any disruption to the coal or lignite supply, and provide daily inventory updates to ERCOT until the inventory level projection increases above 15 days.  Notifications to ERCOT should be via email, sent to FuelSupply@ERCOT.com.
(2)	The requirements of paragraph (1) above do not apply to a QSE of a Generation Resource that uses coal or lignite as its primary fuel if the Generation Resource is located within 15 miles proximity of its fuel supply or was originally designed to be located within 15 miles proximity of its fuel supply and does not have the capability of storing onsite inventory for at least 30 days of operation at the HSL.  The QSE of a Generation Resource located within 15 miles of its fuel supply or that was originally designed to be located within 15 miles proximity of its fuel supply and does not have the capability of storing onsite inventory for at least 30 days of operation at the HSL must notify ERCOT of any disruption to the coal or lignite supply operations that could impact operations of the Generation Resource within two days of such disruption and provide an explanation of such disruption.  Notifications to ERCOT should be via email, sent to FuelSupply@ERCOT.com.
3.25	Submission of Gas Supply Disruption
(1)	A Qualified Scheduling Entity (QSE) that represents a Generation Resource that relies on natural gas as the primary fuel source shall use reasonable efforts to notify ERCOT when:
(a)	A natural gas pipeline operator and/or natural gas fuel supplier issues either:
(i)	A written notification to the QSE, or an affiliate of the Generation Resource or QSE responsible for buying natural gas for the Generation Resource, in accordance with a firm contract, indicating that a gas supply disruption on a natural gas pipeline directly connected to the Generation Resource represented by the QSE is projected to occur or is currently in progress, resulting in curtailment of natural gas deliveries to the Generation Resource; or
(ii)	A written force majeure notice to the QSE, or an affiliate of the Generation Resource or QSE responsible for buying natural gas for the Generation Resource, on a natural gas pipeline directly connected to the Generation Resource represented by the QSE indicating a gas supply disruption; and
(b)	The QSE determines that the Generation Resource’s ability to supply electricity will be significantly limited by the gas supply disruption.  Notification under paragraph (1) will include a description of the potential impact to the operation of the Generation Resource.
(2)	Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, a QSE that represents a Generation Resource that relies on natural gas as the primary fuel source shall ensure that the High Sustained Limit (HSL) and Current Operating Plan (COP) accurately reflect the amount of output the Generation Resource can produce based on an amount of natural gas that the QSE expects it can procure after exploring all accessible and reasonable options. 
(3)	Notifications shall indicate which Generation Resources are reasonably expected to be impacted by the gas supply disruption based on the criteria above and the expected timeline of the disruption, based on available information. 
(4)	Notifications to ERCOT shall be via email, sent to fuelsupply@ercot.com.
